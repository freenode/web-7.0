    <p>First­ly, I would like to apol­o­gise for the in­ter­rup­tions the net­work has ex­pe­ri­enced in the last week (and con­tin­ues to ex­pe­ri­ence as we speak). I would also like to thank our in­cred­i­ble serv­er spon­sors for the time and ded­i­ca­tion they have shown in help­ing us at­tempt to deal with the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
<p><strong>Spon­sors</strong> -- spon­sors are the lifeblood of the net­work; with­out spon­sors there would be no freen­ode. Un­for­tu­nate­ly, the re­cent at­tacks have been sig­nif­i­cant enough for some of our spon­sors to pull the plug as they were un­able to con­tin­ue pro­vid­ing the same lev­el of as­sis­tance to the net­work as they had in the past. These kind of at­tacks can be cost­ly for our spon­sors; the dis­rup­tions soon have a fi­nan­cial im­pact for spon­sors and their pay­ing clients when ser­vice is dis­rupt­ed. They are also cost­ly in time and re­sources spent try­ing to al­le­vi­ate the is­sues caused with­in their net­works. To those of our spon­sors who have had to dis­con­tin­ue spon­sor­ship, in part or in full, I would like to thank you for the years of sup­port. Not just for freen­ode but for the Free and Open Source Soft­ware Com­mu­ni­ties and we can only apol­o­gise for the dif­fi­cul­ties your or­gan­i­sa­tions have ex­pe­ri­enced as a re­sult of these re­cent at­tacks.</p>
<p><strong>Free and Open Source Soft­ware Com­mu­ni­ties</strong> -- whilst spon­sors may be the lifeblood of the net­work, the FOSS com­mu­ni­ties are our rea­son for be­ing. Un­for­tu­nate­ly they, along with our spon­sors, are the ones suf­fer­ing at the hands of the at­tack­er(s) -- it is their projects that are dis­rupt­ed and af­fect­ed and we can only apol­o­gise for the in­sta­bil­i­ty and dis­rup­tion ex­pe­ri­enced by projects on the net­work in this last week.</p>
<p><strong>freen­ode</strong> -- iron­i­cal­ly freen­ode is the puz­zle piece that gets off light­ly. We're just a bunch of peo­ple pas­sion­ate about FOSS -- the net­work it­self is de­void of feel­ing and whilst our vol­un­teers do their best deal­ing with the af­ter­math of the at­tacks and try to keep the net­work up and run­ning the re­al­i­ty is that in the grand scheme of things freen­ode is noth­ing. freen­ode is just a means to an end; the projects that have cho­sen to use freen­ode could eas­i­ly go else­where, the vol­un­teers who staff the net­work... well, they could eas­i­ly go wher­ev­er their projects went -- we vol­un­teer for freen­ode be­cause we're pas­sion­ate about FOSS, and the ma­jor­i­ty of us also con­tribute to one or sev­er­al FOSS projects or have done in the past. For us it has nev­er been about "freen­ode" -- it has been about FOSS; and the projects we, as in­di­vid­u­als, care about. We are all freen­ode users first, and staffers sec­ond.</p>
<p>If there was no freen­ode, there would be oth­er al­ter­na­tives -- per­haps sim­i­lar al­ter­na­tives, per­haps very dif­fer­ent al­ter­na­tives. The FOSS com­mu­ni­ties are full of tal­ent­ed, pas­sion­ate peo­ple and I have no doubt that we'd all find dif­fer­ent ways to stay in touch and work on our projects even if there was no freen­ode.</p>
<p>That's not to say we're about to throw in the tow­el -- we've all in­vest­ed a lot of time and ef­fort in the net­work and I am sure we will con­tin­ue to do so for as long as there are projects want­i­ng to use it and spon­sors will­ing to help us.</p>
<p>I wish I could pro­vide you with de­tailed in­for­ma­tion about the at­tacks and the cause of them -- but these de­tails are but a mys­tery to us and with near­ly 90,000 users I'd be loathe to spec­u­late as to who we might have an­noyed... or how. For the time be­ing, we in­tend to con­tin­ue mit­i­gat­ing at­tacks where pos­si­ble and con­tin­u­ing to en­deav­our to pro­vide ser­vice as usu­al!</p>
<p>Once more, thank you for the sup­port and the faith in the project -- and thank you for the pa­tience whilst our in­fra­struc­ture team des­per­ate­ly tries to jug­gle our in­fra­struc­ture around to bring back as much of our nor­mal ser­vices as is pos­si­ble at this point in time.</p>
