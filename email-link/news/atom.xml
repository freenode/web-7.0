&lt;a href="http://freenode.net/news/django-and-freenode"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your chance to ask Django all your questions about them: 
How do they utilize freenode? How can you contribute? And just who are these
Django Girls we've heard so much about? Anything that you would be interested
in learning about them, here's your opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMA is scheduled to take place on Wed Feb 22 18:00:00 UTC, 2017,
so grab your calendar and make sure you don't miss it.
You can watch the AMA in #freenode-ama and participate by asking questions

&lt;p&gt;Our community support channels include #django and the
&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-users"&gt;django-users mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.
Discussions about the development of Django itself are held
in #django-dev and the
&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-developers"&gt;django-developers mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. #django-sprint
provides a chat for sprint participants, including those who want to
join remotely. Finally, private discussions of the Django team are held
in the #django-core channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep our community safe and welcoming, Django's
&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/"&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; applies to

&lt;p&gt;We're currently working toward releasing Django 1.11, our next
long-term support release, in April. This will be the last version of
Django to support Python 2.7. Meanwhile, Django's master development
branch is targeting Django 2.0 and will support Python 3 only. More

&lt;p&gt;When Aleppo comes up in the news, many of us find ourselves thinking about those
kids and what happened to them. One of our volunteers invested a fair amount of
time trying to figure out where they ended up. When discussing it recently, he
shared his experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a few weeks of surreal crazy chaos we worked out that they were using a
Java IRC client - and internet café PCs - to connect to our system.  They
didn't know what it was for or why it existed but they'd found real-time
online communication for the first time and were enjoying the shit out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first used IRC in the 90s when an IRC client was given to me by a friend not
very long after it was the medium for some of the first ever real-time citizen
journalism during the 1991 Gulf War. In much the same way that someone threw
some software at me in a computing lab in Oxford and showed me how to use it
to chat, these kids were sharing and collaborating in the streets and using
new tools to talk to the guy a computer or a block or a neighbourhood over
with equal ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tried to shepherd a group of unruly teenagers into a corner where
they would cause less trouble for everyone else, I got to know a couple of the
better English-speakers quite well; they seemed mostly to be basically decent
kids growing up much too quickly and experiencing my corner of the internet
for the first time. They were mostly in Aleppo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Arab Spring progressed they grew in number and it was genuinely cool
watching them discover and explore. But as spring turned to summer and then
autumn, they gradually dropped in number and started to vanish. After a while
I realised they'd mostly gone, and I tried to track some of the stragglers
down to find out what had happened to the ringleader or any of the kids I'd
gotten to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringleader had been killed in shellfire, was the answer. I found his blog.
It had been silent for a couple of months. Eventually it fell off the internet
when the account was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a year later they all seemed to have gone I made more of an effort to do
some digital anthropology and figure out just what had happened to them in
more depth. I talked to a Lebanese peer who ran some adult Arabic language
discussion spaces and he speculated that by that point hey had all died or
fled and crossed the border into other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the sobering condition of the world around us, it would be
easy to forget about the positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the privilege of seeing thousands of people work on thousands of
projects they love, and it's humbling and exciting to be allowed to play a small
part in each of them. We're extremely grateful for that: we love learning about
your projects; we love learning about the different ways in which people
communicate and collaborate; we love learning about what you produce and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have exceptionally generous sponsors who not only provide us with hardware
and bandwidth but also with their continued time and expertise when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to one such sponsor we have also secured the majority of the requisite
funding to put on a two-day live conference which will take place in the UK in
August 2017. Further details and a formal announcement will follow early in the
New Year. We are incredibly excited and hope that you will join us; we'd love
for your project to exhibit or perhaps you could give a talk? Keep an eye out
for our announcement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, we would like to thank you all for using freenode and wish you the
very best for 2017!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Celebrating Fedora 25 with freenode</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/celebrating-fedora-freenode" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-21T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-12-21T12:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Justin W.

&lt;p&gt;On November 22nd, 2016, the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview"&gt;Fedora
Project&lt;/a&gt; released Fedora 25,
the latest and greatest version of our
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel"&gt;Linux-based&lt;/a&gt; operating
system. For &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2003-November/msg00000.html"&gt;over thirteen
years&lt;/a&gt;,
the Fedora community has worked to bring the leading edge of open source
development to the world. Fedora's focus is guided by its &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Foundations"&gt;Four
Foundations&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Freedom,
Friends, Features, First&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Freedom&lt;/em&gt; is representative of Fedora's
commitment to championing free and open source software and contributing
back to upstream projects for the benefit of the open source community.
&lt;em&gt;Features&lt;/em&gt; stands for Fedora's commitment to driving some of the newest
features &lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;. Some of these examples include the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)"&gt;Wayland display
server&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"&gt;systemd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_3"&gt;GNOME
3&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps most
importantly, &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; are for the friendships made by contributors from
around the world who help make every release of Fedora possible. Part of
why &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; is an important part of the Four Foundations is
communication. Fedora community members come from all over the planet,
including six out of seven continents. The tools we use to communicate
help us collaborate, solve problems, and build friendships. IRC and
freenode are an important part of how we communicate. Fedora registered
our first channel on freenode on December 29, 2002. As we celebrate
thirteen years of open source collaboration and the newest release of
Fedora 25, the Fedora community wanted to reflect on our longstanding

&lt;h2 id="how-fedora-uses-freenode"&gt;How Fedora uses freenode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a large open source project, there are many different teams and
sub-projects in Fedora that help move us toward a new release. Just like
there are many parts to a car's engine, there are many parts to Fedora's
engine. Some of these groups are officially recognized sub-projects like
the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design"&gt;Design team&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CommOps"&gt;Community
Operations&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docs_Project"&gt;Docs
team&lt;/a&gt;. Other times, they
are informal &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:SIGs"&gt;Special Interest

contributors together to focus on specific topics like programming
languages or desktop environments, like the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Python"&gt;Python
SIG&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/KDE"&gt;KDE
SIG&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, each of these
groups or teams will have their own IRC channel to coordinate in. The
Design team uses &lt;code&gt;#fedora-design&lt;/code&gt;, the Python SIG uses &lt;code&gt;#fedora-python&lt;/code&gt;…
and so on. In total, Fedora has over 175 registered channels to its
name. Frequently, teams will hold public meetings in the freenode
channels to work through tickets, plan ahead on upcoming tasks, or
discuss important topics for their team. There are a series of special
meeting channels used for this purpose. Using the
&lt;a href="http://meetbot.debian.net/Manual.html"&gt;MeetBot&lt;/a&gt; plugin, Fedora uses our
own &lt;a href="https://github.com/fedora-infra/supybot-fedora"&gt;zodbot&lt;/a&gt; to help run
meetings, mark up links or important ideas, and create a pretty HTML
summary at the end of the meeting. All of these summaries and full logs
are found at
&lt;a href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/"&gt;meetbot.fedoraproject.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tips-to-using-irc-effectively"&gt;Tips to using IRC effectively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless different workflows, IRC clients, and handy plugins
available to customize the IRC experience. In the spirit of the
&lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; Foundation and the Code of Conduct, Fedora contributors are
encouraged to &lt;a href="https://getfedora.org/code-of-conduct"&gt;always be excellent to one
another&lt;/a&gt;. It's important to
follow good manners in any IRC channel, Fedora or any other. Having good
manners in IRC are as important as it is in real life. Be courteous to
others, and if in doubt, it's good to assume the best intentions by
others. IRC is important for Fedora, and many contributors have put
together guides of our own as well. You can read more tips from the
Fedora team in our &lt;a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/beginners-guide-irc/"&gt;IRC Beginner's
Guide&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/"&gt;Fedora
Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next-for-fedora"&gt;What's next for Fedora?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2016 comes to an end, we're wrapping up on our own new release of
Fedora 25. The Fedora community is looking forward to helping drive open
source innovation and contributing to the Linux community for many years
to come. Fedora currently has more than 2,000 contributors, and in the
tenth percentile of active contributors, 65% of them are from the
community (&lt;a href="https://mattdm.org/fedora/2016flock/StateofFedoraAugust2016-v160731a.pdf"&gt;State of Fedora, Flock
2016&lt;/a&gt;).
The Fedora steam engine is chugging ahead, and we're excited to see
where it takes us next. We're happy to be able to have shared past,
current, and future milestones together with the freenode community.
Keep an eye out for Fedora Ambassadors in Europe during
&lt;a href="https://devconf.cz/"&gt;DevConf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;.
You can also find us in North America at &lt;a href="https://brickhack.io/"&gt;BrickHack
2017&lt;/a&gt;. And there will be more events all through
the year you can keep an eye out for us at!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A brief security update from the infrastructure team</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/PSA-brief-update-infra" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-20T05:30:34+00:00</published><updated>2016-12-20T05:30:34+00:00</updated><author><name>christel</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2016-12-20:/news/PSA-brief-update-infra</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A freenode volunteer has identified and responded to a suspected compromise of their e-mail accounts, which could have provided

blogged&lt;/a&gt; about resurrecting Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, Tor users can once more connect to freenode over Tor; the hidden
service address is&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following an embarrassingly long period of no Tor support, we &lt;a href="resurrecting-tor"&gt;recently
blogged&lt;/a&gt; about resurrecting Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, Tor users can once more connect to freenode over Tor; the hidden
service address is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;freenodeok2gncmy.onion
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden service requires SASL authentication, as before. In addition, due to
the abuse that led Tor access to be disabled in the first place, we have
unfortunately had to add another couple of restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must log in using SASL's &lt;code&gt;EXTERNAL&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE&lt;/code&gt; (more
    below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you log out while connected via Tor, you will not be able to log in without
    reconnecting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't set up the requisite SASL authentication, we recommend SASL
EXTERNAL. You'll need to generate a client certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 1000 -nodes -out freenode.pem -keyout freenode.pem
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and consult your IRC client's documentation to find out how to use it to
connect. Connect to freenode over TLS on the plain Internet and &lt;code&gt;/msg NickServ
CERT ADD&lt;/code&gt; to authorise it to your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll then want to tell your client to try the &lt;code&gt;EXTERNAL&lt;/code&gt; mechanism. We lack
comprehensive documentation for this, but it's a feature in most modern
clients—check their docs for instructions for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's currently not possible to register an account for use with Tor without
connecting at least once over the Internet. We're investigating our options, and
would like to provide a solution to this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Resurrecting tor-sasl</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/resurrecting-tor" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-05T16:09:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-05T16:09:00+01:00</updated><author><name>edk</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2016-09-05:/news/resurrecting-tor</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many of you will no doubt be aware, freenode used to run a Tor hidden

have a few configuration things to take care of. The test network may be reset,
rolled back, or shut down at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
