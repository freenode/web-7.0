&lt;p&gt;As most of you are aware, we've been experiencing significant spam over the
past few weeks. As a result, we have decided to roll out a server-side spam
filter. Unlike our current spam-mitigating techniques, this system applies to
private messages and does not let the first matching line get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various ethical concerns have been raised over the course of introducing this
feature. They'll be addressed below. The short version, though, is that the
system has various limitations built in designed to prevent operator abuse.
Only a tiny bit of information can get out of the filters, and they do not have
access to much information themselves, to the extent that we believe the
obvious ways to abuse such a feature are impractical.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various ethical concerns have been raised over the course of introducing this

Only a tiny bit of information can get out of the filters, and they do not have
access to much information themselves, to the extent that we believe the
obvious ways to abuse such a feature are impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've historically been reluctant to take steps like this, and we remain so,
but we believe the disruption has reached such a level that this is necessary
to allow the communities using freenode to collaborate effectively. The prior
complement of anti-spam measures represents our preferred approach, and we
intend to employ this only when they prove insufficient to minimize disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the technically inclined, you can view the changes
&lt;a href="https://github.com/freenode/ircd-seven/compare/000aa02980b812a18652fc2cc21041eb7adc980b...6ffdaf49400643a922fc9086f7a645ddd07013a6"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could this be used to spy on users?&lt;/em&gt; Which filter a user matched is not
  reported to staff, only that one did. This limits the theoretical maximum
  rate of passive monitoring to one bit per message, far less than the
  information content of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recipients of private messages are not included in the line that filters
match on, so staff cannot use spam filters to see who is talking to whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could this be used to shadowban users?&lt;/em&gt; No. If a filter blocks a message,
  its sender is either disconnected from the network or sent an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the filter system is configured not to use the nick, username, or
hostname for filter matching, so it can't discriminate against particular
users at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact information filters "see" is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type of message (PRIVMSG/NOTICE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The target of the message, if that target is a channel. For private
  messages, filters can see that they are PMs but not who their target is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether or not the sender is identified (but not their account name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full contents of the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code can be configured to filter on the &lt;code&gt;nick!user@host&lt;/code&gt; of the sender. We
haven't enabled this, and have no current plans to, but this is subject to
change should the nature of the spam demand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering is always performed on the server originating a message, and inside
the ircd process. This system will never cause a message to be distributed
more widely than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff can, as always, answer your questions about this change, and we welcome
constructive feedback. Private messages to staff are not subject to filtering.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Continued and persistent spambot attack and clarification</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/spam-shake" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-06T06:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-08-06T06:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>christel</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2018-08-06:/news/spam-shake</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware there has been a prolonged spambot attack directed at freenode (and other IRC networks) in recent weeks, targeting a number of individuals involved with freenode and the wider IRC communities. The freenode team, and people involved with the wider IRC communities, are working hard to mitigate and reduce the spam that hits your community channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spam content has changed in the last few days and while I am extremely glad that the attacks appear to no longer focus on members of the volunteer team and no longer involve libellous and false statements relating to these volunteers, we feel we should provide some clarification on some of the claims that are being made in the current spamwave relating to freenode and its involvement in Handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current spambot attacks state that freenode is involved with an 'ICO scam' relating to the &lt;a href="https://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake&lt;/a&gt; project. Most freenode volunteers have involvement with one or several FOSS projects, often projects that use the freenode network as part of their communications toolbox. Handshake is no different in this regard, as it is a project that I have been involved with. I am deeply sorry to those affected by the spam, to freenode and to Handshake that spammers have chosen to use my involvement as a further platform to attack the freenode communities, and now also Handshake. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware there has been a prolonged spambot attack directed at freenode (and other IRC networks) in recent weeks, targeting a number of individuals involved with freenode and the wider IRC communities.

&lt;p&gt;The current spambot attacks state that freenode is involved with an 'ICO scam' relating to the &lt;a href="https://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake&lt;/a&gt; project. Most freenode volunteers have involvement with one or several FOSS projects, often projects that use the freenode network as part of their communications toolbox. Handshake is no different in this regard, as it is a project that I have been involved with. I am deeply sorry to those affected by the spam, to freenode and to Handshake that spammers have chosen to use my involvement as a further platform to attack the freenode communities, and now also Handshake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to announcement, the Handshake project raised USD 10.2 million in funding from project supporters and the project made the decision to not only give a substantial amount of its coin supply to people and projects within the FOSS sphere but to also donate the USD 10.2 million (FIAT) to projects whose work the initial project contributors admire and/or rely upon. Like many projects within the FOSS world, Handshake has extensively used other free and open source software to build its codebase, and FOSS also lies at the foundations of the internet architecture that we rely upon day to day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the projects Handshake identified as useful is indeed also freenode, which is on the pledgee list to receive a FIAT donation from the project. This donation will, among other things, contribute towards making the &lt;a href="https://freenode.live"&gt;freenode #live&lt;/a&gt; conference bigger and better, and also to focus on some development work that has otherwise been on the back-burner. freenode is happy to be included as a list of recipients and honoured to be appreciated in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is a FOSS project, and like many FOSS projects it has a channel on the freenode network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer DNS for which one aim is to be more resistant to censorhip than existing systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is doing a faucet distribution to a number of FOSS contributors and projects, many of which are freenode users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is making a fairly hefty (USD 10.2 million) overall financial contribution to projects within the FOSS sphere in addition to its faucet allocation of HNS coins and freenode is one of many projects within the FOSS sphere that is receiving a contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, any link between freenode and Handshake is tenuous at best and the current wave of spam would appear to be designed to do little bar discredit freenode and the Handshake project both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you will appreciate that the freenode volunteer team is not in a position to answer questions relating to the Handshake project any more than they are in a position to answer questions relating to any other new FOSS project that starts to use the freenode network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also understand that some of you may have additional questions relating to Handshake, I am sure you will appreciate that the freenode website is not the platform for such a discussion, and would suggest that you visit the &lt;a href="https://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/handshake-org"&gt;Handshake Github Repository&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://handshake-org.github.io/"&gt;Handshake Documentation&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in learning more about the project and that you direct any questions to the Handshake project via the appropriate communication channels for the project.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Current spambot attack on freenode (and elsewhere)</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/spambot-attack" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-27T13:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-27T13:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>christel</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2018-07-27:/news/spambot-attack</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many of you will have noticed that over the last few days there has been an extensive spambot wave on freenode, and on other networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure that I addressed these concerns, and I can assure you that there are no plans on the part of freenode or LTM that involve any changes to freenode, freenode is not on the brink of shutdown — if anything, we are excited to be celebrating our 20th anniversary at this year's &lt;a href="https://freenode.live"&gt;freenode #live&lt;/a&gt; event, and we hope to see at least another 20 after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freenode project exists to support the development and use of Free and Open Source Software, and to that end it serves a very different purpose to the one that the visionaries behind irc.com have in mind. I fully believe that freenode and irc.com can co-exist, just as we co-exist with the numerous other IRC networks out there, and I would like to hope that irc.com may encourage those of their users who would be a good fit for freenode to come check us out, just as I hope that we may be able to send someone their way should we come across users who have great potential for running a series of training sessions or similar.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In light of the two ongoing threads on &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17375831"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/irc/comments/8t2wcq/irccom_acquired_by_london_trust_media_plans_for_a/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; concerning LTMH and irc.com, we have had a fair few freenode users contact us with questions as to whether irc.com will replace and/or absorb freenode, and what impact it would have on freenode communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while LTM has provided freenode with some much needed resources following last year's &lt;a href="https://freenode.net/news/pia-fn"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, any potential partnership between the two will be limited to the possibility of freenode being represented in the irc.com foundation. It is my understanding that the foundation will operate on a nonprofit basis and will seek to bring together network operators and ircd/services developers to identify irc-related projects that are in need of funding and support, the irc.com team hopes to establish positive working relationships with operators, developers, ircv3 and end users alike, and the foundation, which will be governed by community consensus, will seek to ensure that irc.com and its efforts benefit all, not only those organisations that LTM supports today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to irc.com itself, I am curious and excited to see what's in store in terms of utilising IRC as a platform for delivering training sessions and the idea of a virtual incubator using an IRC backend. There has been some incredible developments on the client-side in recent times, with both &lt;a href="https://irccloud.com"&gt;IRCCloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kiwiirc.com"&gt;KiwiIRC&lt;/a&gt; continuing to work on features that will soon introduce video and voice calls, file-sharing and a host of other productivity tools that provide the irc.com team with good foundations for success.&lt;/p&gt;

support any racist or hate-inciting behaviour, which is strictly against our
&lt;a href="http://freenode.net/policies"&gt;terms of use&lt;/a&gt;, and that the channel(s) referenced
in the spam messages are in no way connected to the spam - rather they are
innocent victims of a "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_job"&gt;Joe Job&lt;/a&gt;"
designed to disrupt them as well as freenode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there's little we can do to stop it on other networks, reporting each
individual sighting, particularly in #freenode, is of limited value and likely
to cause more noise than signal, but feel free to message a staffer (use the
&lt;code&gt;/stats p&lt;/code&gt; command to see who's available) if you have concerns, or particularly
if you are part of the oper/staff team on another affected network and want to
talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>On Shadowbans</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/shadowban-fix" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-15T23:59:04+00:00</published><updated>2017-11-15T23:59:04+00:00</updated><author><name>edk</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2017-11-15:/news/shadowban-fix</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's recently come to our attention that an unintended effect of combining
channel modes allowed channel operators to set undetectable bans and quiets on
users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freenode considers this to be, in short, antithetical to our values and approach
to moderation. While we recognise the challenges of moderating large channels,
we urge channel operators to be as transparent as possible, and believe that
users should be aware of moderation action taken against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this, we are deploying a change to the &lt;code&gt;$j&lt;/code&gt; extban. As of tomorrow

I apologise on behalf of the staff team for any confusion this may have caused.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
