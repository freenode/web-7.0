## Contributing

- Whenever possible, one commit per feature.
- If feature/pull-request branches have only one developer, please regularly
  rebase them onto master until they are merged in.
- Don't merge branches with meaningless commit messages; always squash them
  instead.
- Wait for discussion of big changes. Your branches will still be here
  tomorrow.
