    <p>First­ly, I would like to apol­o­gise for the in­ter­rup­tions the net­work has ex­pe­ri­enced in the last week (and con­tin­ues to ex­pe­ri­ence as we speak). I would also like to thank our in­cred­i­ble serv­er spon­sors for the time and ded­i­ca­tion they have shown in help­ing us at­tempt to deal with the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
<p><strong>Spon­sors</strong> -- sponsors are the lifeblood of the network; without sponsors there would be no freenode. Unfortunately, the recent attacks have been significant enough for some of our sponsors to pull the plug as they were unable to continue providing the same level of assistance to the network as they had in the past. These kind of attacks can be costly for our sponsors; the disruptions soon have a financial impact for sponsors and their paying clients when service is disrupted. They are also costly in time and resources spent trying to alleviate the issues caused within their networks. To those of our sponsors who have had to discontinue sponsorship, in part or in full, I would like to thank you for the years of support. Not just for freenode but for the Free and Open Source Software Communities and we can only apologise for the difficulties your organisations have experienced as a result of these recent attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Free and Open Source Soft­ware Com­mu­ni­ties</strong> -- whilst sponsors may be the lifeblood of the network, the FOSS communities are our reason for being. Unfortunately they, along with our sponsors, are the ones suffering at the hands of the attacker(s) -- it is their projects that are disrupted and affected and we can only apologise for the instability and disruption experienced by projects on the network in this last week.</p>
<p><strong>freen­ode</strong> -- ironically freenode is the puzzle piece that gets off lightly. We're just a bunch of people passionate about FOSS -- the network itself is devoid of feeling and whilst our volunteers do their best dealing with the aftermath of the attacks and try to keep the network up and running the reality is that in the grand scheme of things freenode is nothing. freenode is just a means to an end; the projects that have chosen to use freenode could easily go elsewhere, the volunteers who staff the network... well, they could easily go wherever their projects went -- we volunteer for freenode because we're passionate about FOSS, and the majority of us also contribute to one or several FOSS projects or have done in the past. For us it has never been about "freenode" -- it has been about FOSS; and the projects we, as individuals, care about. We are all freenode users first, and staffers second.</p>
<p>If there was no freen­ode, there would be oth­er al­ter­na­tives -- per­haps sim­i­lar al­ter­na­tives, per­haps very dif­fer­ent al­ter­na­tives. The FOSS com­mu­ni­ties are full of tal­ent­ed, pas­sion­ate peo­ple and I have no doubt that we'd all find dif­fer­ent ways to stay in touch and work on our projects even if there was no freen­ode.</p>
<p>That's not to say we're about to throw in the tow­el -- we've all in­vest­ed a lot of time and ef­fort in the net­work and I am sure we will con­tin­ue to do so for as long as there are projects want­i­ng to use it and spon­sors will­ing to help us.</p>
<p>I wish I could pro­vide you with de­tailed in­for­ma­tion about the at­tacks and the cause of them -- but these de­tails are but a mys­tery to us and with near­ly 90,000 users I'd be loathe to spec­u­late as to who we might have an­noyed... or how. For the time be­ing, we in­tend to con­tin­ue mit­i­gat­ing at­tacks where pos­si­ble and con­tin­u­ing to en­deav­our to pro­vide ser­vice as usu­al!</p>
<p>Once more, thank you for the sup­port and the faith in the project -- and thank you for the pa­tience whilst our in­fra­struc­ture team des­per­ate­ly tries to jug­gle our in­fra­struc­ture around to bring back as much of our nor­mal ser­vices as is pos­si­ble at this point in time.</p>
