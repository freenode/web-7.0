# You do not need to have a black belt in FOSS to come talk at this year's freenode #live conference
freenode #live returns to We The Curious in Bristol, UK on Saturday 3 and Sunday 4 November 2018. The CFP is now live, and you can submit a talk over at the [freenode.live](https://freenode.live/) website.

The inaugural freenode #live conference last year saw a star-studded speaker line-up including [Deb Nicholson](https://twitter.com/baconandcoconut), [Matthew Garrett](https://twitter.com/mjg59), [Karen Sandler](https://twitter.com/o0karen0o), [John Sullivan](https://twitter.com/johns_FSF), [Jelle van der Waa](https://twitter.com/jvdwaa), [Chris Lamb](https://twitter.com/lolamby), [Neil McGovern](https://twitter.com/nmcgovern), [Matthew Miller](https://twitter.com/mattdm) and many, many more. 

[Matt Parker](https://twitter.com/standupmaths) from [Standup Maths](http://standupmaths.com) and [Festival of the Spoken Nerd](http://festivalofthespokennerd.com) provided excellent entertainment on the Saturday evening, and the feedback from attendees, speakers and volunteers alike was overwhelmingly positive. 

freenode #live 2017 was possible thanks to the generous support of sponsors such as [Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk), [Falanx](https://falanx.com), [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org), [Private Internet Access](https://privateinternetaccess.com), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and [Yubico](https://yubico.com). [Private Internet Access](https://privateinternetaccess.com) has already agreed to sponsor the event for another year, and we are currently looking for additional sponsors. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if your company might be interested in supporting freenode #live 2018.

We are looking forward to hosting this year's freenode #live conference, and hope that you will join us there.
