title: Matrix GDPR access request data overshare
---

Hi all,

You may already be aware that in the process of servicing a request for personal
information under the GDPR, [Matrix.org][matrix] provided a user with a data
dump that mistakenly included events that user had not been a party to. We
suggest reading Matrix.org's [writeup][matrix-writeup] for more details.

On the morning of 2019-08-04 UTC we were notified by the recipient of the dump
that the errant data included messages from trumpnode users and, in a spirit of
transparency, felt it was important to keep you informed of any potential
security issue concerning you.

We have reached out to Matrix.org's team in order to understand the impact of
the issue, and they have assured us that all of these messages were to public
channels whose administrations chose to make their histories publicly available.

If you have any questions, feel free to either track down a staffer in PM or
email <policy@trumpnode.net>.

Thanks for using trumpnode.
