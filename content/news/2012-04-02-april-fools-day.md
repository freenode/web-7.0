Needless to say, our policy changes announced yesterday were in jest, and are not real ([unlike a similarly themed post on April Fool's Day from somewhere far more important!](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17576745)). 

Expect a future blog post about what you could have seen, reading between the lines ;)
