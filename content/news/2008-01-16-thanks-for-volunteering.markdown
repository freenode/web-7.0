title: Thanks for volunteering!
---

Thank you to all those who have responded to our [recent call for volunteers](http://blog.freenode.net/?p=65). We have been somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of applicants and are pleased to see so many interested in help keep freenode running. Due to the Head of Staff going on holiday, and due to the amount of e-mails received, we are running a little behind on replying to each and every applicant. Hopefully, everyone should have a response by the end of the weekend.
Thank you for your patience and we hope you will keep enriching freenode.
