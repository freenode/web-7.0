title: Java webclient decommissioning
---

Following our successful switch of cloaking on our web gateway ([http://webchat.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net)) to show the full IP address of connecting users (see [this blog post](http://blog.freenode.net/2010/06/freenode-webchat-changes/)), we have decided to transition our old and relatively unused Java client ([pjIRC](http://www.pjirc.com/main.php)) to our webchat service. This will be done via a HTTP redirect.
Only around 30 users at a time can be found from the java client, hence as time goes on it makes less and less sense to continue to support this platform. We'll be decommissioning the Java client on Sun 8th August.
Other pjIRC instances which connect to freenode will be unaffected. We are simply removing our version of the program.
If you've any concerns, queries or comments we'd love to hear from you either in #freenode or via support at freenode.net.
