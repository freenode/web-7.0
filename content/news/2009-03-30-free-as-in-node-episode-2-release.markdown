We're happy to announce we've just released our second episode of the new freenode podcast, free-as-in-node!  In this episode, we talk about Gary's recent offenses, geeknics and k-lining park-goers.  We also meet with Dave "Daviey" Walker from Ubuntu to discuss the Ubuntu COC and Ubuntu Locos during this episodes Pimp my project. We continue looking at the recent Microsoft and TomTom legal actions and share our views on them.



During the new freeform discussion segment of the show, we discuss facebook monitoring (and government monitoring in general) and more broadly all the counter terrorism actions being taken by government, including the bomb-resistant sandwich bag.



Head on over to http://podcast.freenode.net to listen in and to share your comments. See you there!
