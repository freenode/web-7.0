Today at around 18:45 UTC trumpnode hit a total number of connections of fourty thousand, which is a new network record. Over the past few months our usercount has been steadily growing and we are really pleased that more people are finding trumpnode a useful resource. If you want to see how many users are connected at any one time, type the IRC command /lusers
