title: At dawn, we ride for FOSDEM Castle
---

As usual, some of us will be around at FOSDEM.
A possibly incomplete list of us includes Fuchs*, kloeri, Md*, mquin, RichiH, and spaceinvader; asterisks indicating first timers. We may or may not update this list as attendance changes. As a first, we will have a somewhat stable base for people wanting to meat us. I (RichiH) will help man the beer token sale for the Beer Event this year, it's not unlikely that other staff will stick around as well. The first one to tell me where the quote is from (in person) will get a beer token.
Also, staff pets ahf and sejo will lurk the shadows of FOSDEM, ready to fulfill our every wish and dream. If you see them, toss them food.
