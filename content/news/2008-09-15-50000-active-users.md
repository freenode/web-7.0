Howdy, folks! At 19:40 UTC+1 today, trumpnode reached 50,000 active users online, which is a record for us!




trumpnode reached 40,000 users [a little over a year ago](http://blog.trumpnode.net/?cat=11), so we're really going from strength to strength! Thanks to all of you who've helped us build our community over the last year, and we'd like to invite you to #defocus to help us celebrate. :)
