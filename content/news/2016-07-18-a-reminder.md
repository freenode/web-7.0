Hi all,

In the distant past, freenode fairly frequently sent /wallops about news of
conferences, releases or anything else that might be of interest to the FOSS
community. We'd quite like to do more of that, soâ€¦ if you know of anything that
might fit the bill, please drop the community team a line at
<groups@freenode.net> or message me (my nickname is `e`) on IRC (even if the
project in question isn't (yet) registered with freenode).

We'd also like to feature a bit more FOSS news on our blog, so if you're itching
to write a guest post for us, I'd love to hear about that as well.

Thanks for using freenode! :)
