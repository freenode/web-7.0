  A quick note on a few current topics. First, new manual group   registrations have been, if anything, slower than before. We apologize for   this; we're working on ramping up the freenode-registry project and concentrating on   coding for the moment. The code is in the early prototyping stage and is   going fairly slowly, though it's beginning to pick up speed.  However, the   current manual group registration process is suffering while we work on   the code which will eventually automate our processes. We'll try to pick   off some of the more active projects in the group registration queue and   get them moving again. Thanks in advance for your patience.

A new social channel,      [#freenode-groups](irc://chat.freenode.net/#freenode-groups),      has been set up for current holders of      [primary channel](http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#primarychannels)      group cloaks. If you're not in that category, the channel will forward you   to      [#freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net/#freenode),      the old network staff social channel, which is actually currently   forwarded, in turn, to      [##bookmark](irc://chat.freenode.net/##bookmark)      (on a temporary basis) while we sort out which channels the network   project is going to use.

Also, you may have noticed that the 2006-2007      [PDPC](http://freenode.net/pdpc.shtml)      fundraiser has not yet begun. Preliminary budgeting suggests that we're   very much on track for 2006-2007. We'll likely have one or two small   fundraisers during this fiscal year rather than a single large one. We'll   keep you posted, and you can help us stay on track by      [making a donation](http://freenode.net/pdpc_donations.shtml)      now instead of later.

Finally, the staff of freenode and PDPC want   to thank you for using the network. We're grateful that you continue to   use the network in record numbers, and we'll keep doing our best to help   things run smoothly. Have an excellent week!
