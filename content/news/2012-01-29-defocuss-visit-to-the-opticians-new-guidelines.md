A couple of months ago, mrmist posted about the #defocus-focus channel, which was looking to improve the atmosphere in #defocus.

One of the areas that has been concentrated on is improving the ruleset for the channel.  A number of people including Fuchs, dax, Ttech and others have involved in this improvement process.

As a result of the efforts of all the fantastic people involved in that channel, we now have a new set of guidelines for #defocus. You can read them on [our website](http://freenode.net/pounddefocus.shtml).

Hopefully these changes bring the guidelines up to date with the general expectations and aims of the channel. As always, comments are welcome!
