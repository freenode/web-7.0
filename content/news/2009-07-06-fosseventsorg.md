[fossevents.org](http://fossevents.org) is an open source event aggregation site created by the Peer Directed Projects Center, the nonprofit organization the operates freenode.  Our goal with this new site is to make it easy to find open source events near you, that interest you.  Many of us have missed events that were right around the corner because we didn't know about them until it was way too late.

As we grow this site we'll be adding new and interesting ways to monitor open source events, so keep an eye on it.
