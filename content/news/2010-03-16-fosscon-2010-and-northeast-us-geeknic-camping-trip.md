There are two pdpc-related events coming up in the Northeast US we'd like to make you aware of. The first is the second "geeknic++" camping trip, to be held May 21st-23rd in Worthington State Forest, NJ.  Last year, there was much fun to be had as geeks (and their families) from all over the Northest gathered for 2 nights of camping in a New Jersey State forest.  This year there is a new location, but more of the same fun.  See [http://geeknic.org/?p=91](http://geeknic.org/?p=91) for details. The trip is only $20 for adults, and kids under 18 are free.

Second, is our very first fosscon, a free and open source conference organized by and for the foss community.  This event will be held June 19th in Rochester NY.  Lots of interesting speakers are lining up but there is still room for more if you have an interesting topic of your own, and sponsorship opportunities are still available.  Visit[ http://fosscon.org](http://fosscon.org) for more details on this exciting event.

We hope to see you at one or both of these great events!
