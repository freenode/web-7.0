title: '[Scheduled Maintenance] Major Server Maintenance'
---
To update status, we're still scheduling major server maintenance at 7am   UTC Sunday 22 May 2005 (that's midnight in Los Angeles, 3am in New York   City, 9am in Brussels and 5pm in Sydney). Seven, not six, major servers   will be restarted, and the entire network will be affected. We anticipate   that this process may take up to an hour, rather than the 15 minutes   previously reported. Thanks again for your support and understanding.
