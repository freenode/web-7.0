Just a quick note to wish each and every one of our users, sponsors, donors, volunteers and projects for making freenode great.

It's amazing being able to communicate and collaborate with such a variety of people and projects. **YOU** make the network what it is and help us provide a fantastic resource for FOSS communities.

I'd also like to say a special "Thank You" to Martin (Martinp23) Peeks and Richard (RichiH) Hartmann for squeezing into my size 7's and keeping a tight grip on the steering wheel ensuring that we don't weer off track and crash into too many icebergs during my leave from active freenode management duties. You're doing a tremendous job, and I'm thrilled to see that you've got the support from the fantastic volunteer base and our exceptional sponsors.

Have a happy Christmas (or whichever holiday you do or do not celebrate) and a fantastic New Year, I hope it brings you everything you wish for!

Oh. And don't forget, tis the season for [giving!](http://freenode.net/pdpc_yearly.shtml)

Cheers,

Christel x
