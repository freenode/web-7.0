title: PDPC Design Contest!
This is a quick reminder about the contest still being on, and anyone interested are encouraged to get in touch with us by e-mailing design@freenode.net

As the PDPC grows and expands it has become clear that we would benefit greatly from a better web presence, and we would like to invite you to participate in our web design and logo contests.

We are announcing a public contest to design http://pdpc.us. The contest is open to all interested individuals, companies and organizations. To enter, please submit one or two PNG or SVG images that show the front page as well as a sub-page should the design differ on the two. At this stage we want only a design mockup; a fully-functional website is not required. Entries for the logo design should contain a PNG or SVG image of your design. The deadline for submissions for both contests is 20:00UTC on April 14th, 2007.

The PDPC board along with freenode staff will select the top 5 candidates for each contest, which will then be posted publically for everyone to review. We will then put the finalists through a community voting process.

Since the PDPC as an organisation believes strongly in open development and free information, we naturally have a strong preference for designs that rely only upon open standards; designs that rely upon flash animation or other proprietary formats are discouraged. The ideal design would be easily navigable and pleasant on the eye, and should be flexible enough that it can be used on other affiliated sites. The possibility for discreet advertising space is also desired. For practical and legal reasons, we will need to retain copyright on the winning design, so please do not submit entries for which this is problematic.

Psst. There is a prize!
