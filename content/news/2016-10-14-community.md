Hi,

You might not be aware that freenode has a dedicated community team and that we
would be delighted to help your projects get the most from freenode. The
freenode community team consists of christel, edk, JonathanD, mquin, Myrtti,
nhandler, Swant and tomaw, and we would love to help you spread the word about
releases and launches, conferences or events and any other project milestones
that may be of interest to our shared communities. We are happy to make
announcements on IRC, reshare your social media posts and we would love for you
to guest author or co-author a blog post for the freenode website.

If you think this is something that would be useful for your project, please do
not hesitate to get in touch with us! You can find us in `#freenode-community`
or drop us a line to <community@freenode.net>.

Make sure not to miss any interesting news by setting `/umode +w` (or `/mode
yournick +w`).
