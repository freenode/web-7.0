    * **##buggles**

	
    * Referencing: _Video Killed the Radio Star_ by The Buggles.

## Crypto


The list number references the level number of the listed question.



	
  1. Blog post of **##bhggbyhapu**

	
    * This is a simple [ROT13 cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rot13)

	
    * where AtoN, BtoO, CtoP, etc.

	
    * python -c "print 'bhggbyhapu'.decode('rot13')"

	
    * The answer is: **##outtolunch**




	
  2. pTShnJAmo3W0

	
    * This is base64 encoded **then** ROT13'ed.

	
    * python -c "print 'pTShnJAmo3W0'.decode('rot13').decode('base64')"

	
    * The answer is: **##panicsort**




	
  3. [http://i.imgur.com/AArVy5H.png](http://i.imgur.com/AArVy5H.png)

	
    * JWGUBNYMGBQWOI is the text

	
      * This text is encrypted using a [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)

	
        * Here is a script I built to decrypt/encrypt [Vigenère ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) [http://git.io/TLfWTg](http://git.io/TLfWTg)




	
      * The key is **git**. This is from the reference of [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_torvalds) in the image.

	
      * The answer is: **##DONOTUSENVIDIA**







	
  4. QOZTMLUVG IPAJGECYZ | Don't forget to nT92MKV= | orange

	
    * QOZTMLUVG IPAJGECYZ

	
      * This is a [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) again.

	
      * The key is **JUICE**. This is hinted at by _orange_.

	
      * Searching the web for the unencrypted text, **HURRICANE EGGBEATER** yields [https://xkcd.com/944/](https://xkcd.com/944/)




	
    * nT92MKV=

	
      * This is the same as the previous level, rot13'ed and then base64'ed.

	
      * python -c "'nT92MKV='.decode('rot13').decode('base64')"

	
      * **hover**




	
    * If you **hover** over the comic on [https://xkcd.com/944/](https://xkcd.com/944/) you'll see:

	
      * _After exhausting the OED, we started numbering them. When overlapping hurricanes formed at all points on the Earth's surface, and our scheme was foiled by Cantor diagonalization, we just decided to name them all "Steve". Your local forecast tomorrow is "Steve". Good luck._

	
        * This next step is a bit of a leap, but we expected you to search for key phrases in the string. You should end up on [Cantor's diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) on wikipedia. From here you'll see some description of it. We want the most popular example of Cantor's diagonal argument, which is Russell's Paradox. (_Can a set of all sets contain itself?_)







	
    * The answer is **##russell'sparadox**




	
  5. [http://git.io/Y60F5g](http://git.io/Y60F5g) | 936 | UHG | NZCBXBXUSXDBXIWZWMMLLVLHM | WEQ | I'm So Meta Even This Acronym | freenode | 12 | ♥

	
    * The /topic changed a little bit during the game. This is the most recent form.

	
    * Hints given:

	
      * 2013-04-01 18:51:18 <yano> i think you should focus more on how you "cracked" the code for the last

	
      * 2013-04-01 18:51:32 <yano> and by code i mean, QOZTMLUVG IPAJGECYZ

	
      * 2013-04-01 18:52:12 <yano> UHG and WEG are pretty important

	
      * 2013-04-02 04:13:28 <yano> it is vigenere

	
      * 2013-04-02 05:42:38 <yano> **one more semi-important hint: UHG | NZCBXBXUSXDBXIWZWMMLLVLHM | WEQ are each encrypted with the same KEY and method**




	
    * The last hint pretty much gave it away for many people.

	
    * UHG | NZCBXBXUSXDBXIWZWMMLLVLHM | WEQ

	
      * This is [vigenère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) again.

	
      * The key is **IRC** ROT**12**-ed.

	
        * **IRC** is expected to come from the reference of _I'm So Meta Even This Acronym_ and _freenode_ as in an acronym of/about freenode.

	
        * The **12** comes from the number directly in the /topic.

	
        * UGH decrypts to

	
          * 


**AES**





	
        * NZCBXBXUSXDBXIWZWMMLLVLHM decrypts to

	
          * 


**TWOHUNDREDANDFIFTYSIXBITS**





	
        * WEQ decrypts to

	
          * 


**CBC**








	
      * Now, let's take a break and follow a pattern from previous levels. Let's pull up [https://xkcd.com/936](https://xkcd.com/936)

	
        * This should be obvious given the previous pattern of XKCD being involved in these levels.




	
      * While viewing that you should probably download [http://git.io/Y60F5g](http://git.io/Y60F5g)

	
        * wget http://git.io/Y60F5g




	
      * Y60F5g is encrypted with AES-256-CBC. This is provided by the previous clues.

	
      * The key for the encrypted file is **Tr0ub4dor&3**

	
        * This is obtained from the XKCD comic: [https://xkcd.com/936](https://xkcd.com/936)




	
      * openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -in Y60F5g -out Y60F5g.plaintext

	
      * The output of the file is: **##K&R**




	
    * The answer to this level is **##K&R**





The topic in **##K&R** was: _Congratulations! You have completed freenode's crypto challenge! | Make sure to also play the other quizzes, and take this with you ###est | [http://git.io/TLfWTg](http://git.io/TLfWTg) _

With **###the** and **###best** and **###est** you are expected to put these pieces together to find **###thebestest**

Congratulations to those who have completed all the tracks and levels!
