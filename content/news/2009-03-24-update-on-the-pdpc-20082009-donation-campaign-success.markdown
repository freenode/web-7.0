title: Update on the PDPC 2008/2009 donation campaign (SUCCESS!)
---

We are happy to announce that we have in fact reached our 2008/2009 fund raising goals, and as such are no longer in danger of losing charity status.  At present, we have exceeded the required amount (£5,000) by at least £200 and we here are all very excited (and relieved) to have accomplished this with your help.  We would like to offer our thanks to each and every one of you who helped out and contributed.  This truly shows just the sort of thing the community is capable of.  We'd also like to offer thanks Canonical in particular for their help in reaching our goal through their matching of £1,700 of donations by others.
We appreciate all of your help, and as always, thank you for using freenode.
