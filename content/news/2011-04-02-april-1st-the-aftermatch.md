Some of you might have remembered the wolfgame bot in #defocus from 2008-04-01. Reception was even better this time and people really liked it. We might even make this a tradition. Feedback in comments, please.

To get your wolfgame fix during the rest of the year, join #wolfgame . We are waiting :)

We will publish the solutions to our riddles here, but we had to promise to not do so before Sunday so we won't. Watch this space if you are interested.

Also, remember [our new nick expiry times](http://blog.freenode.net/2011/03/change-in-nick-expiry-times/). This is now active policy.
