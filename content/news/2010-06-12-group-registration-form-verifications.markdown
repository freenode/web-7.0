title: Group Registration Form verifications

For a long time, freenode has utilised a [Group Registration](http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml) system to give groups (such as companies and open source projects) the ability to manage channels in the [primary namespace](http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnaming) (ie, channels beginning with a single "#") and to give contributors to their projects [cloaks](http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#cloaks). Perhaps more importantly, the system allows groups to retain control of their identity on freenode. It is because of this aspect of Group Registration that filing a [Group Registration Form (GRF)](http://freenode.net/group_registration_form.php) has been necessary for projects to acquire primary channels which have been already registered. For the same reason, we ask those who register new primary channels to file a form.

A great number of fantastic projects use freenode. Only a small subset of staff are able to handle GRFs, and in combination with the large volume of forms filed we have developed a significant backlog. We realise that because of this backlog, certain groups are unable to claim channels on freenode which should rightfully be theirs. While we appreciate that many projects have been waiting months or years for a form to be processed, we must consider GRFs filed in order to obtain channel ownership for a legitimate project to be a priority - if you're in the former position and not the latter, I hope you can see why.

At this stage, we are hoping to move through these priority requests in the coming weeks (and, depending on volume, months), before moving on to other requests. **If you are a prospective group contact who has filed a GRF form before and you fall into the priority group (to be clear: you are in the priority group only if you need the GRF to be processed in order for you to gain access to the #group or #project channel on freenode), please email us at **_**grfprocess at freenode dot net**_**.** The email should contain your IRC nick and your group's name - no other personal information should be sent. We will soon be in touch regarding "next steps".

If you want to help us to provide a top class service to groups, please consider getting involved with development of our new [Group Management System (GMS)](http://freenode.net/gms.shtml).

Finally, a quick word of gratitude to those who have been waiting for GRFs to be filed for a long period of time. Thank you for your patience - we **will** move on to processing your requests as soon as we are able, and will let you know when via this blog and network wallops. Thanks for choosing freenode :)
