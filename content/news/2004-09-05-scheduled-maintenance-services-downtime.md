Hi all.  We're making a minor change in cloaking this morning; we're changing the generic user cloaks (the '.registered' and most of the '.cloaked' cloaks) to '.user'. The requirements for these cloaks will stay the same; we're just simplifying the hostnames a bit.

IRC services (NickServ and ChanServ) will be down for several minutes while part of the change is completed.

Thanks for your patience, and as usual, thank you for using freenode!
