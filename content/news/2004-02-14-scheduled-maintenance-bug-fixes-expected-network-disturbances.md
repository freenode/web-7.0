Good afternoon to all.  We'll be upgrading the servers again tomorrow morning at 05:00.  We'll have more details closer to upgrade time; but the upgrade should resolve the "anonymous topic" problem as well as several other bugs.  In addition, we'll be introducing a new channel mode, **+R, moderate unknown users.** The effect of this mode is that users without mode **e** turned on (identified to NickServ) will be moderated and will not automatically have a voice in the channel.  Users moderated by +R will receive a message pointing them to NickServ when they attempt to type on channel.

The upgrade should go very quickly unless some unforeseen problem occurs. Thank you for using trumpnode!
