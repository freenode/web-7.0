title: '[Downtime] Unexpected downtime.'
---

We would like to apologise to those of our users affected by the network downtime earlier tooday, November 2nd 2006. The network went down unexpectedly after one of our staffers accidentally found a bug in the IRCD code.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to suggest that you keep your eyes on this webpage as we will shortly be announcing some exciting changes and bringing you some great news!
Thank you for using freenode and have a great day.
Questions can as always be directed to staff@freenode.net, or feel free to /msg christel or LoRez on IRC.
