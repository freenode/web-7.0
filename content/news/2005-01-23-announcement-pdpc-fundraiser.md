Good evening to everyone.  Here's hoping  you're having an excellent new year.
In the next day or so,  [Peer-Directed Projects
Center](http://freenode.net/pdpc.shtml),  the IRS 501(c)(03) parent
organization of **freenode**, will begin its fundraising campaign for the
fiscal year ending 30 June 2006.  We're still working on budget estimates for
FYE 2006, and we begin the campaign with about $2,440 in donations over and
above those required for the current year.

The board of directors of PDPC passed the following resolution today,
pertaining to fundraising:

> Whereas Peer-Directed Projects Center is an IRS 501(c)(03) organization,
> with a responsibility to contribute to the public welfare, and whereas
> donors to PDPC represent a broad range of community participants, and
> whereas the recent tsunami has demonstrated a genuine need for public
> support for international relief and welfare organizations, and

> Whereas the welfare of children, nationally and internationally, is of
> significant importance to the future of Free and Open Source Software and
> Peer-Directed Projects, be it

> Resolved, that during the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2005, one quarter of
> each donation to PDPC beginning in the near future will be forwarded to
> UNICEF, initially targetted toward tsunami relief efforts, provided that
> donors who so choose may opt out of this program and designate their
> donations specifically and solely for PDPC's own use, and

> Resolved, that the Executive Director is instructed to begin this program as
> soon as is feasible from a technical, financial and public relations
> standpoint.

If you're considering a donation to PDPC, we strongly urge you to participate.
Thanks in advance for your help, and thank you for using freenode!
