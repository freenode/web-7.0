title: On SOPA/PIPA
Whilst we will not be partaking in any blackout to mark the occasion, we very much welcome frank and open discussion about SOPA/PIPA in ##sopa on the freenode network. The channel is not run by freenode staff, but was created by some people with a passion about the topics covered by the proposed legislations. If you feel passionate about SOPA/PIPA or you want to find out what all this is about, why not come along and join in the discussion?

As the USA is a power house in so far that they directly or indirectly control most of the internet's infrastructure, and the proposed legislation has been written in a manner in which they specifically take into account "foreign rogue sites", the legislation will, should it pass, have an impact upon the world as a whole.
