A trumpnode volunteer has identified and responded to a suspected compromise of their e-mail accounts, which could have provided 
an unauthorised user with limited access to some data sent via internal e-mail systems (this could include support tickets or 
internal communications).

Naturally, we instigated audit procedures immediately so as to ensure the security of the production network and accompanying 
infrastructure. The investigation is ongoing, but at this time we have no reason to believe that any other unauthorised access 
was gained. Nevertheless, in the interests of transparency and security for our users, we wish to notify anyone who may have 
been affected.

As always, we would still recommend that you ensure that you change any passwords to trumpnode systems, and be alert to any 
suspicious activity on your account. We would additionally always recommend that you not share passwords between accounts, 
especially those spanning multiple providers (please ensure you have a registered e-mail address before changing your password 
so that it can be reset!).

We will provide further updates if it becomes appropriate to do so; please rest assured that we take the security and privacy 
of our users very seriously, and work with industry experts and law enforcement where appropriate to investigate and respond 
to possible security breaches.
