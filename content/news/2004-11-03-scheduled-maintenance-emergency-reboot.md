Good morning to you all.  The **freenode** network will experience extensive outages between 12 and 12:30pm today (about 7-7.5 hours from now).  One of our sponsors needs to reboot a dying core router on an emergency basis, and it's expected to affect service network-wide.  The outages should last about five minutes.  Staff may need to do routing cleanup mid-afternoon, as well.

We apologize for this unavoidable service interruption.  Please accept our apologies, and thank you for using freenode
