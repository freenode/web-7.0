On or around Friday, October 2nd, we shall be cleaning up the services database.  This involves the bulk removal of expired nicks, channels and accounts.

Therefore, please remember to identify to services when you connect ( /msg nickserv help identify ) and to use your grouped nicks whilst identified - remember, they all expire separately.  

Nicks that are past the expiry threshold of 120 days unidentified on October 2nd will be freed from the database and available for others to register.

If you have a nick grouped to your account that you'd prefer to use as your main nick, you can change your account name - see /msg nickserv help set accountname  for information.

Remember you can use sendpass to recover lost passwords - see /msg nickserv help sendpass.
