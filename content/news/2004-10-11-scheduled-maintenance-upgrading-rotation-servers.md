title: '[Scheduled Maintenance] Upgrading Rotation Servers'
---
About 11 hours from now, at 06:00 (1am in Chicago, 8am in Paris, 3pm _[whoops, 3:30pm --ed]_ in Adelaide), we'll be rebooting several main rotation servers to perform upgrades.  Much of the network will be affected, but if all goes well, we should be finished within a half hour.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Thanks for your understanding, and thank you for using freenode!
