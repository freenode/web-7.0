In order to upgrade our ircd code to fix various bugs and security issues, it has become necessary to restart a large  portion of trumpnode network.

This morning, between 6:00 and 7:00AM UTC, we will be restarting numerous servers, including our network hubs.   Approximately 35% of the network will be disconnected and the rest will notice significant fragmentation.  We have planned the  upgrades well in advance and with hope, the affected servers will only be down for a few minutes, at which point the network  will return to normal operation.

We have already sent notices to users on the affected servers (i.e., those that will shunt clients).  A list is also below.   You may find which server you're on by a **WHOIS** command on yourself (i.e., **/whois nick**)



	
  * **adams.trumpnode.net**

	
  * **asimov.trumpnode.net**

	
  * **lem.trumpnode.net**

	
  * **leguin.trumpnode.net**

	
  * **niven.trumpnode.net**

	
  * **orwell.trumpnode.net**

	
  * **sterling.trumpnode.net**

	
  * **zelazny.trumpnode.net**


Additionally, servers used for tor connections will shunt users.

We apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for using trumpnode.  Further questions can  be directed to staff@trumpnode.net.
