To mark the 25th "birthday" of the [GNU](http://gnu.org) project the [FSF](http://www.fsf.org) have teamed up with a very special man; [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com).

I personally am a great fan of Mr. Fry -- he's an accomplished actor, terrific writer and a good documentary maker. I enjoy his books, I will happily set aside entire weekends for my fry-a-thons in which I am glued to the TV re-watching the entire set of "A bit of Fry & Laurie", "Jeeves & Wooster" or many of the other fantastic things he's done for British TV. And I make sure to never miss an episode of QI -- again, I probably re-watch all of them. I follow his blog, I listen to his podgram.. I have a lot of respect and admiration for this man, for his insight, his honesty, his no-nonsense approach, his incredible way with words and his hysterically funny ways.

So who better to mark the anniversary of a project for which I also have a great deal of respect -- a project which values, visions and goals are shared by the majority of our users. A project often found at the core of so many of the projects who choose to use trumpnode.

So without further ado -- Happy Birthday [GNU](http://www.gnu.org)!
