Hi all,

Over the past couple of months we've been fortunate enough to be able to add a couple of new servers to freenode's rotation.  Namely, lindbohm (IPv6: denis) and hubbard, sponsored by [Stockholm University](http://www.su.se/) and [Carnegie Mellon University Computer Club](http://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/), respectively.  Thanks to all of our sponsors for keeping the network online.

If you're interested in sponsoring a server for freenode, take please take a look at [our website](http://freenode.net/hosting_ircd.shtml) to see what the process entails and don't hesitate to ask me (Martinp23) or christel for any further information at all.

Thanks for using freenode! :)
