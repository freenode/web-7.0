I promised you all that I would write an update when we'd had a chance to review things and speak with the IRseeK people. After a bit of discussion, both amongst freenode staff and with the management of the company which provides the IRseeK service, we are happy to announce that there will be a few changes.



	
  1. The IRseeK service will be on a **opt-in** basis **only.**

	
  2. The IRseeK bots will (on freenode) be cloaked and easy to identify.

	
  3. Logs obtained prior to the service becoming opt-in will **not** be published on the IRseeK website without the explicit permission of the channel owners.


It is our belief that IRseeK and similar services can provide a useful service not only to the IRC community but to other interested users as well, and we (freenode staff) are very happy to see that IRseeK are happy to change their approach to one which is clear and concise rather than covert. I hope that the service can be of benefit to the projects which use freenode, and should you have any queries -- or if you'd like to get in touch with the IRseeK people -- don't hesitate to talk to us and we'll do our best to put channel owners in touch with the IRseeK project.

Again, we encourage projects which do publicly log their channels to make this clear to all users of the channel, by placing a note in the topic or with an on-join message.

I hope this solution is one which our users find satisfactory.
