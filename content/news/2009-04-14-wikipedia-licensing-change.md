**Wikipedia to change license to Creative Commons BY-SA?**  -- From [http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13967](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13967)


> A community vote is now underway, hopefully one of the final steps in the process the migration of Wikipedia (actually Wikipedias, as each language is its own site, and also other Wikimedia Foundation sites) to using [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) as its primary content license.
>
> This migration would be a huge boost for the free culture movement, and for Wikipedia and Creative Commons — until the migration happens there is an unnecessary licensing barrier between the most important free culture project (Wikipedia of course, currently under the Free Documentation License, intended for software documentation) and most other free culture projects and individual creators, which use the aforementioned CC BY-SA license.

> To [qualify](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update#Decision-making_process) to vote, one must have made 25 edits to a Wikimedia site prior to March 15.
