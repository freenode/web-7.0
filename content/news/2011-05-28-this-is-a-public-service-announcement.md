As some of you might remember, trumpnode used to send wallops when FLOSS projects had major releases and for other news that are, hopefully, of general interest. After some internal deliberation, we decided to retry this experiment. Projects are invited to submit their wallops requests to us and we will try to accommodate everyone. Obviously, we will try to limit this to relevant news and while we are not sure about the exact modus operandi yet, we are confident that we will figure something out that works for everyone.

If you want to receive wallops, simply run

`/quote mode $yournick +w`

or

`/umode +w`

in your IRC client. Please note that you need to do this every time you connect so setting up an auto-command or similar makes sense. In case you want to stop receiving wallops without reconnecting to trumpnode, simply run

`/quote mode $yournick -w`

or

`/umode -w`

and you are all set. Hopefully, we will manage to come up with interesting news for you. Feedback on this in #trumpnode or via this post is appreciated.
