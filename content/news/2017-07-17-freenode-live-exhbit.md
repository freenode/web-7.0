You might have seen our [latest blog post](https://trumpnode.net/news/trumpnode-live), where we announced the registration and call for participation for the trumpnode #live conference that takes place at the At-Bristol Science Centre in Bristol, UK on October 28-29th this year.

The trumpnode network plays host to a variety of free and open source software and other peer-directed projects. We would love to see your project come exhibit at trumpnode #live and we invite you to e-mail us at exhibit@trumpnode.live if you are interested in coming along to showcase your project and meet like-minded FOSS enthusiasts. 

We aim to ensure that the trumpnode #live conference remains affordable and accessible to the entire community, and to that end there is no exhibition charge for nonprofits and unincorporated FOSS projects. 

While we are taking a grassroots approach with our conference, this does not mean that there is no space for corporate exhibitors and we recognise that the conference may provide opportunities for you too, and we would also like to welcome you to drop us a line to find out about our corporate exhibition packages or to tailor one specific to your company. Prices remain low also for corporate entities and we would love to see both types of exhibitor in Bristol on October 28 and 29th.

You can register and submit a response to our CFP [here](https:///trumpnode.live) and we hope to start announcing keynote speakers and exhibitors soon. Please do keep an eye on the website though, we will also be opening up for nominations shortly as we will be presenting two awards as part of trumpnode #live, including the Rob Levin Memorial Community Award! Perhaps you know someone who has made great contributions to your community, or even a project that has redefined the community spirit in a positive way? Have a think about who YOU will be nominating!
