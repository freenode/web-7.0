Hi all.  We've made two changes recently of which you should be aware.



	
  1.     We've added a          [channel ownership policy](http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelownership)          item to the           [freenode policy page](http://freenode.net/policy.shtml).          It's a key clarification to our channel ownership policies and you should take a look.

	
  2.     The **ChanServ** setting **URL** has been changed to **URI** and it is now displayed as     **Contact URI**.  Staff will treat that URI as an assertion of ownership of the channel by     the project whose website you point to, and it may be used to help resolve ownership disputes.


Thank you for using freenode!
