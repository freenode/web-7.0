Get your calendars out and start thinking of tricky questions,
once again [the freenode community team](http://freenode.net/news/community)
is pleased to announce another AMA, this time [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
will be our guest. Read more about them in the
[blog post](http://freenode.net/news/django-and-freenode) published last week.

Take the oppurtunity to ask Django all your questions about them,
how they utilize freenode, how you can contribute, or anything else you would
be intrested in learning about them

The AMA is scheduled to take place on Wed Feb 22 18:00:00 UTC, 2017.
You can watch the AMA in #freenode-ama and participate by asking questions
in #freenode-ama-questions during the session.

We hope to hold more Ask Me Anything sessions in the future.
If this is something your project would be interested in, please
reach out to us in #freenode-community or at community@freenode.net.
