While talking online is great, meeting in person presents brand new opportunities... and we would like to meet you!



In 4 days (on June 19th, 2010), a number of us as well as members of the community in general will be meeting up for a conference in Rochester, NY, at Rochester Institute of Technology.  We are greatly looking forward to this awesome new opportunity.



Fosscon features 14 talks and 4 workshops. Below are just a few examples.



Free and Open in Education; More than just Software - Charles Profitt



Making the Most of Communities - Bryan Ostergaard



OpenStreetMap - Richard Weait



Linux in Business - Karlie Robinson



Resume Building Workshop with RIT's Office of Co-Op and Placement



And many others, as well as Bird of a Feather sessions and an exhibition hall full of local users groups and interesting organizations.



We hope to see you there. Visit [http://fosscon.org/](http://fosscon.org) for more info or [http://fosscon.org/register](http://fosscon.org/register/) to sign up.
