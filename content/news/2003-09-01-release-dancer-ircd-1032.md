We're pleased to announce that dancer-ircd  [1.0.32](http://source.freenode.net/%7Easuffield/dancer/dancer-ircd/1.0/releases/dancer-ircd-1.0.32.tar.gz)  has been released.  It's up on the testnet and we'll probably be doing limited production testing at some point during the week.  We believe that the cmode +J, +b/+q and +e issues and the services shutdown hub crash issue are resolved by this release.

In other news, we're sorry to report that the Freenode Radio project is being put on hold for the time being.  We hope to reinstate FNR in the near future, at least on a pilot project basis. We understand that **MysticOne** and other participants are moving on to other streaming radio projects, and we wish them well.
