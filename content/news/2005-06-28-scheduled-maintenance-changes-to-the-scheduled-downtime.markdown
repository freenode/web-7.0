There's a slight change in the outage schedule.    The outages are now planned to last up to an hour and a half, beginning at   8:30am UTC (1:30am Los Angeles, 10:30am Brussels and 5:30pm Sydney) on:   Wednesday, 29 June 2005

We'll try to keep things running as well as possible during the outage   periods, but there will be disruption--we appreciate your understanding   and patience.
