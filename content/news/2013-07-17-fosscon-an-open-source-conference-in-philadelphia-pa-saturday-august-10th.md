FOSSCON 2013 will be held on August 10th, 2013.  Several of our very own staff here at freenode will be attending this year and we are really looking forward to it.




FOSSCON was spawned from the depths of freenode and this will be the 4th event so far.




We are very excited about this year’s keynote speaker, Philadelphia’s own Jordan Miller, who leads a research team at The University of Pennsylvania. Jordan makes heavy use of open source software and is doing amazing work with 3D printing as it pertains to transplant organs.  [http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/penn-researchers-improve-living-tissues-3d- printed-vascular-networks-made-suga](http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/penn-researchers-improve-living-tissues-3d-%20printed-vascular-networks-made-sugar)r.
