title: [Scheduled Maintenance] Memory Upgrade

We'll be restarting a main rotation server on either Monday or Tuesday at   5:00am, in order to perform a memory upgrade. The server has been removed   from rotation and, so far, no more than about 2,000 users should be   affected. Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding.
