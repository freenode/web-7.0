title: PHP TestFest

<blockquote>The TestFest is an event that aims at improving the                   [code coverage](http://gcov.php.net/) of the                   [test suite](http://qa.php.net/running-tests.php) for the PHP language itself. As part of this event, local User Groups (UG) are invited to join the TestFest. These UGs can meet physically or come together virtually. The point however is that people network to learn together. Aside from being an opportunity for all of you to make friends with like minded people in your (virtual) community, it also will hopefully reduce the work load for the PHP.net mentors. All it takes is someone to organize a UG to spearhead the event and to get others involved in [writing phpt tests](http://qa.php.net/write-test.php). The submissions will then be reviewed by members of php.net before getting included in the official test suite.</blockquote>
