**First,** if you're involved with bookkeeping or accounting for a small not-for-profit entity, particularly in the FOSS community, please consider maintaining a presence on the new **#accounting** channel on **freenode**.  This channel was set up to provide mutual support for small not-for-profit entities in the area of bookkeeping and accounting.  Examples: use of UCoA for general ledger and reporting, accrual-based accounting techniques, basic bookkeeping.  Please   [stop by the **freenode** IRC network](http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml),  channel **#accounting**.

**Second,** if you're thinking of using PayPal to donate to our parent not-for-profit entity,  [Peer-Directed Projects Center](http://freenode.net/pdpc.shtml),  today would be a good day to do so.  PayPal has announced a free day due to its recent problems.  It will be refunding fees on all transactions, until 11:59pm US/Pacific (6:59am 29 October 2004 UTC).  So, you have about ten hours to make that donation with no fees charged to PDPC.  Please take the opportunity to make your donation go a bit farther!

Thank you for your support to date, and thank you for using **freenode**.
