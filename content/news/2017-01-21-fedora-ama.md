The [freenode Community Team](news/2016-10-14-community) is pleased to announce a new
opportunity to learn about one of our many groups on freenode.
Justin W. Flory (jflory7) from the Fedora project has agreed to follow-up on
his recent [blog post](news/2016-12-21-celebrating-fedora-freenode) with an "Ask Me
Anything" (AMA) session.

For those of you who might not be familiar with an AMA, as its name suggests,
it is an opportunity for you to ask the Fedora project all of those questions
that you have been wondering. You can ask about the project itself, how they
utilize freenode, ways to start contributing, or any other topics you might be
interested in learning more about.

The session is scheduled to take place on Wed Jan 25 18:00:00 UTC 2017.
You can watch the AMA in `#freenode-ama` and participate by asking questions in
`#freenode-ama-questions` during the session.

We hope to hold more Ask Me Anything sessions in the future. If this is something
your project would be interested in, please reach out to us in `#freenode-community`
or at <community@freenode.net>.
