title: Changes to the organisational structure of freenode
category: announcements
---

We have changed the organisational structure of freenode a bit. The new structure will be slightly more compact, based on 3 main teams and team internal roles. Decisions affecting all of freenode will be taken by staff as a whole, while specific tasks are mostly taken care of by the corresponding teams and their members. You can find out more about the teams and their area of expertise at https://freenode.net/people

There are interesting times ahead, collaborating with our colleagues from OFTC https://www.oftc.net/ we will switch to a new, tailored ircd called solanum.

Detailed information on this and how you can test it and help out will follow in a separate blog post soon.

Despite the new organisation, our daily operations and goals stay the same. 
Together we are freenode; a network, a service, a community for free and open source software, peer directed projects and all the people working together for broadly licensed, easy to access code, information and knowledge.
