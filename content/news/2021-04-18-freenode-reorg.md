title: Changes to the organisational structure of freenode
category: announcements
---

We have changed the organisational structure of freenode a bit.
The new structure will be slightly more compact, based on 3 main teams and team
internal roles. Decisions affecting all of freenode will be taken by staff as a
whole, while specific tasks are mostly taken care of by the corresponding teams
and their members. You can find out more about the teams and their area of
expertise under [the people](/people).

There are interesting times ahead, collaborating with our colleagues from
[OFTC](https://www.oftc.net) we will switch to a new, tailored ircd
called solanum.

Detailed information on this and how you can test it and help out will follow in
a separate blog post soon.

Despite the new organisation, our daily operations and goals stay the same. 
Together we are freenode; a network, a service, a community for free and open
source software, peer directed projects and all the people working together for
broadly licensed, easy to access code, information and knowledge.
