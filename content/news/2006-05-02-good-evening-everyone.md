  We'll be rehubbing our European servers at about 6am UTC tomorrow, in   about 9 hours (11pm US/Pacific, 8am Europe/Paris, 4pm Australia/Sydney).   We're returning our normal hubbing, which was modified several days ago   due to backbone connectivity problems between our US and Europe hubs. This   correction should reduce transatlantic latencies.

Thanks to everyone for your patience and understanding, and thank you for   using freenode. Have a great night!
