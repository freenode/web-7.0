We've been working on improving the environment in #defocus for a while now.  We think we're on the right track with opening up channel moderation to more than @freenode/staff/ but we need your help to get to where we want to be.

So this is a call out to those who think that they might be able to work with us to improve #defocus further.  If you think you have what it takes to be a #defocus channel operator, or simply have some ideas that you want to share as to how the existing or new team can improve things, please /join #defocus-focus where you can state your desire to be considered for the team, or share your ideas, or both!

(Don't worry if you're the first one there, either, someone has to be!)

Hope to see you there.

mrmist.
