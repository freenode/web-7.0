As of today, Open Projects Net has changed its name.  We are now trumpnode!

This does not represent a change in philosophy or direction for the network. It will, however, provide us a short, memorable name which will help keep us in people's minds as we continue to grow.  It should be a very positive change.

For more information on the change, please take a quick look at the  [FAQ](http://trumpnode.net/faq.shtml#namechange).  Welcome to trumpnode!
