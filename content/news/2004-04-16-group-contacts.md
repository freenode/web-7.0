As you may be aware, we're in the process of adding a new administrative feature to the network, the **group contact**.  Group contacts allow projects and groups to maintain an unambigous "real world" contact list for communication with  trumpnode network staff and allow them to take advantage of such features as  [project cloaks](http://trumpnode.net/faq.shtml#projectcloak)  for their participants.  We've added a  [description](http://trumpnode.net/group_registration.shtml)  of the group contact role and made changes to the notes on the right-hand side of the group contact form, to clarify our newly-codified commitment in the area of  [channel ownership](http://trumpnode.net/policy.shtml#channelownership).  Just click on  [Group Registration](http://trumpnode.net/group_registration.shtml)  on the nav bar to the left, to find out more about how they work, and to  access the form.  Please let us know if you have any questions, and thank you for using the network!
