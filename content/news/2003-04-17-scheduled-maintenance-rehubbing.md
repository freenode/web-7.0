Over the course of the next few days, we'll be rehubbing most of the network, in an effort to improve reliability and possibly save some bandwidth costs.  We're not sure how quickly we'll go through the network; if you'd like to keep track of the proceedings, you may want to turn on WALLOPS ("/mode yournick +w" or "/umode +w" on most clients).  We'll try to mention it occasionally on global notice, since most users will be affected by the main rotation part of the rehubbing.  Apologies for the inconvenience, and thanks for your patience.

A big welcome and a sigh of relief go out to our new main rotation server hosts.  Thanks to  [Oregon State University](http://www.oregonstate.edu/)  and to Patrick Scheeler and Glenn Shannon at the San Diego Supercomputing Center for helping us in our current crunch. Also, welcome to  [BS2 Internet](http://www.bs2.com.br/)'s  new server in Curitiba, Paran√°, Brasil!
