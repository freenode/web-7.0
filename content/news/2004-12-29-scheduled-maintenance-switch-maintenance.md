Good morning and best wishes during the holiday season.  One of our sponsors has scheduled switch maintenance for New Years' Eve morning, 31 December 2004 at 1am UTC.  This maintenance could take as little as two minutes or as much as forty-five.  There is the possibility of substantial network impact.

Thanks in advance for your patience, and have an excellent New Year. Thank you for using freenode!
