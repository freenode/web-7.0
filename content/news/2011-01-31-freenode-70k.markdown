With apologies to cringing table-top players, we are more than happy to announce that we passed the threshold of 70,000 active users a few minutes ago. Lingering at a maximum of 69,991 lately, we have been anticipating this day for some time, now. And it has come :)

We'd like to thank all of our users for using freenode. Without you we would, quite literally, not have made this milestone.

We would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our volunteers, whatever fields they have chosen to help out in.

At the moment, we're growing at 10,000 users per year and a bit:

We're looking forward to continuing this trend and reaching 80,000 sometime around March of 2012 :)
