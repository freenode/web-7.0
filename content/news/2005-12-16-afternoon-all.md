freenode is currently experiencing a   large-scale nuisancebot infestation. We've temporarily removed the   **irc.freenode.net** rotation, but you can find us on      [chat.freenode.net](irc://chat.freenode.net/).      If you're a client developer or you run an IRC   network list site, please do not list this new hostname without first   emailing **staff at freenode dot net** to make sure it's okay to do so.    Apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for using the network!
