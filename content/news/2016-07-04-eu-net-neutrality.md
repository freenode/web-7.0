As many of you no doubt know, the European Union passed legislation last year
intended to protect
[net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality).
However, it contained
[significant loopholes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/eu-net-neutrality-laws-fatally-undermined-by-loopholes-critics-say)
which many people believe will allow European ISPs to prioritise paying
partners' traffic. Among other things, this is potentially quite scary for
FOSS projects—most of which don't have the kind of funding necessary to enter
into such arrangements.

If this is something that concerns you, campaigns aimed at convincing
[BEREC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_European_Regulators_of_Electronic_Communications)
to close the loopholes are running at <https://www.savenetneutrality.eu/> and
