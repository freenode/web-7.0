As many of you no doubt know, the European Union passed legislation last year
intended to protect
[net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality).
However, it contained
[significant loopholes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/eu-net-neutrality-laws-fatally-undermined-by-loopholes-critics-say)
which many people believe will allow European ISPs to prioritise paying
partners' traffic. Among other things, this is potentially quite scary for
FOSS projectsâ€”most of which don't have the kind of funding necessary to enter
into such arrangements.

If this is something that concerns you, campaigns aimed at convincing
[BEREC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_European_Regulators_of_Electronic_Communications)
to close the loopholes are running at <https://www.savenetneutrality.eu/> and
