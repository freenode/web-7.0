title: [Scheduled Maintenance] Server Upgrades
---
freenode      has tentatively scheduled server upgrades for 6am UTC on Saturday 2 July   2005 (2am in New York City, 8am in Brussels, 4pm in Sydney and 11pm Friday in   Los Angeles). At least three major servers will be restarted, and the   entire network will be affected. This process may take up to an hour. As   always, thank you for your support and understanding.
