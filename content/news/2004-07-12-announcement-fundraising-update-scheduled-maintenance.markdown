---

As you're probably aware, the March-July 2004 fundraiser for  [Peer-Directed Projects Center](http://freenode.net/pdpc.shtml)  is officially at a close.  We've met our fundraising goal, with donations totaling $18,119.42.  Thanks to our corporate sponsor  [Digium](http://www.digium.com/)  and to all of the users of freenode.  We appreciate your help!
**OPERATIONAL NOTE:** We're in the process of moving one of our hub nodes to its permanent fiber.  We'll be rehubbing in about a half hour, sometime around 05:00 UTC, and again in another 8 hours, at 13:00 UTC (midnight and 08:00 US/Central time).  We apologize in advance for the disruption.  Thanks for your understanding.
