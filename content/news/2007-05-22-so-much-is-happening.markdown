---

Today has been an interesting day in 'freenodia', a day of reflection, and a day where both myself and my incredible staff got a feel of what it means to be surrounded and embraced by so many large and vibrant communities as those who choose to use the freenode network. We are proud and happy to host the projects we host, and we are tremendously grateful that by using freenode you allow us to get a peek behind the curtains on how your project operates, which is always refreshing.
We also appeared in the news today, when [NewsForge](http://newsforge.org) and [linux.com](http://linux.com) broke the [news](http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/05/16/2037231) (though, old news to our blog readers!) of [freenode](http://freenode.net) and [OFTC](http://oftc.net) exploring further collaboration.
And we saw some changes to the structure of the PDPC board.


<blockquote>As of the board meeting on May 22nd 2007 a few changes have been made with immediate effect. David Levin has stepped down from his position as President. Christel Dahlskjaer (freenode Head of Staff) replaces him as President by unanimous vote, while David retains a position on the PDPC board.
Phil Stracchino follows in Christel's footsteps, assuming her previous position as secretary pro tem.
Joining the board we have Richard (RichiH) Hartmann in the position as treasurer pro tem, representing freenode staff, and David (cdlu) Graham as a community board member.
All members of the board are excited to be working together to provide even better services to the communities we serve and look forward to a interesting future for PDPC and its sub projects.
We would like to thank all the freenode staff volunteers, server sponsors and users who have helped build up the organization and the projects as they are today. We could not have done it without you and appreciate your continued support and enthusiasm in helping us in our efforts to lay the structures for building vibrant peer directed communities.
Congratulations to the additional board members of the PDPC, both of whom were voted in unanimously.
The corporate officers of the PDPC are as follows:
* Christel Dahlskjaer - President
* Phil Stracchino - Secretary
* Richard Hartmann - Treasurer
The PDPC board of directors:
* Christel Dahlskjaer - Member (Head of Staff, freenode)
* Phil Stracchino - Member
* David Levin - Member
* Richard Hartmann - Member
* David Graham - Community Board Member
In unrelated news, it has come to the attention of freenode and the PDPC Board that certain users of the freenode network have been propagating unfounded rumors concerning the status of PDPC board members and freenode staff, claiming to represent or acting on behalf of the President of the PDPC Board. The Board wishes it to be clearly understood that these users do not speak for or represent either freenode or the Peer Directed projects Center in any capacity, official or otherwise. We politely request that you disregard any rumors about Freenode or PDPC obtained from sources other than official Freenode/PDPC communication channels.
We thank you for your attention, and assure you that PDPC will continue to operate freenode to the best of its ability in the best interests of the network and the F/OSS community.
On behalf of the PDPC board,
Christel Dahlskjaer - President, Head of Staff - freenode
Phil Stracchino - Secretary
David Graham - Community Board Member</blockquote>
