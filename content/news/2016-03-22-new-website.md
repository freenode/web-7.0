If you are reading this you have most probably already realised that our brand spanking new website is up and running. On behalf of freenode I would like to express heartfelt thanks to dsample, edk, Swant, thefam, emerson and SteinSplitter and boxmein -- not only for the help in designing the new website based on a very fickle and constantly changing spec but also for providing tremendously amusing banter and generally being awesome guys! You did beautifully and it has been an absolute pleasure working with you, I can't wait to do it again sometime (soon!). 

Oh, and the new website is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
