Hi everyone.
Currently the freenode webchat instance (webchat.freenode.net) is down. This is due to maintenance by the host of the box upon which the service sits, and looks set to continue for up to a further 6 hours.
This is maintenance that we, as staff, were not previously aware of.
We're very sorry for the inconvenience and are doing what we can to reduce it.

Update: resolved.
