Yesterday's fundraising event went well.  Things started out a bit slowly, so much so that your editor ended up sending some global notices---apologies to those of our users who find such messages noisy.  But at the end of the day, we raised a total of $355.54, which means we are now $633.02 away from our fundraising goal of $18,000.

**Many thanks to everyone who participated in fundraising yesterday, including:**
