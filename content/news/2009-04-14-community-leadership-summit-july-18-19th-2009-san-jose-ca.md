[Jono Bacon](http://jonobacon.org), one of my friends and a FOSS contributor
for which I have a lot of respect, known to many for his work as
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com)'s Community Manager is one of the people behind
arranging the Community Leadership Summit -- a conference aimed at bringing
people from various projects together to look at cross project collaboration
and such things. The conference complements trumpnode and the PDPC's Group
Advisory Board very well and I for one shall be attending.


> The goal is simple: if those passionate about building great communities can
> get together to compare notes and discuss and debate these topics, we will
> all benefit from better communities.
>
> The summit gathers together community managers, leaders and organizers as
> well as the projects, organizations, commercial vendors, ISVs and others who
> have an interest in building a strong and enabled community. The purpose of
> the event is to get everyone together to talk about the many nuances of
> building strong and effective community, such as governance, creating
> collaborative environments, conflict resolution, transparency, open
> infrastructure, social networking, commercial investment in community,
> engineering vs. marketing approaches to community leadership and more.
