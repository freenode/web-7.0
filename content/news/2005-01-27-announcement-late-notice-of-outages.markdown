title: '[Announcement] Late notice of outages'
---

Good morning, all.  We've received last minute news that several of our main hub and leaf nodes may experience outages beginning about five hours from now, from noon until 2pm UTC. Service is being interrupted to perform urgent upgrades to infrastructure equipment.  We're not certain whether the outages will occur once or twice or be intermittent throughout that period.
Apologies for this unfortunate service interruption.  We appreciate your patience and understanding, and thank you for using  freenode.
