Significant network outages are scheduled for just over 17 hours from now, to update server code.  These updates affect main rotation servers and hubs and will significantly affect all users on the network.  The outages are scheduled for 7am UTC tomorrow. We'll make them as brief as we can manage.

Apologies for the inconvenience.  As always, we appreciate your patience and understanding, and we thank you for using  freenode!
