title: Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
---

Another year is coming to an end, for freenode and the PDPC it has been a year of change. We've made a lot of progress on development, the NFP is branching out and starting to slowly move towards providing more services to the FOSS communities and we've grown in size and now peak at a whooping 51,000 users! It feels amazing to see so many FOSS enthusiasts together in one place.
I hope that you all have a fantastic holiday season and that the new year brings you all you wish for! And a massive thanks to each and every user for making it worth our time to provide this service! And of course, thanks also go to all our fantastic volunteers, past and present for the time and effort they put in day after day for free. I look forward to another year with you, and another year working to bring FOSS developers and users together.
