Jonathan mentioned in his [blog post](http://blog.freenode.net/2009/04/free-as-in-node-episode-3-released/) about the free-as-in-node podcast yesterday that this weeks guest on "Pimp My Project" was there to talk about **PHP TestFest**.


> The TestFest is an event that aims at improving the [code
> coverage](http://gcov.php.net/) of the [test
> suite](http://qa.php.net/running-tests.php) for the PHP language itself. As
> part of this event, local User Groups (UG) are invited to join the TestFest.
> These UGs can meet physically or come together virtually. The point however
> is that people network to learn together. Aside from being an opportunity for
> all of you to make friends with like minded people in your (virtual)
> community, it also will hopefully reduce the work load for the PHP.net
> mentors. All it takes is someone to organize a UG to spearhead the event and
> to get others involved in [writing phpt
> tests](http://qa.php.net/write-test.php). The submissions will then be
> reviewed by members of php.net before getting included in the official test
> suite.


As per [http://qa.php.net/testfest.php](http://qa.php.net/testfest.php) Head over there if you want some more information on how to get involved!
