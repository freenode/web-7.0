freenode is pleased to announce a few changes effective May 12, 2007 at 12:55 UTC:



	
  * the (re)formation of #freenode, which will be an official help channel for the freenode network.  For more information, please review the [#freenode channel guidelines](http://freenode.net/poundfreenode.shtml).

	
  * the   closing of #freenode-social.  While#freenode-social has served its purpose for the last couple of years, it has really outgrown itself and is being closed.

	
  * the opening of #defocus, the new social channel for freenode.  #defocus is being launched with anticipation of more to come in the near (or mid-) future. It will differ from #freenode-social in a number of ways, including: (1) like #freenode, has its own set of [channel guidelines](http://freenode.net/pounddefocus.shtml), which should help clarify what is on/offtopic in the channel, and (2) unlike -social, #defocus will be -m, which means you won't require voice to talk.


We truly hope you enjoy these changes and look forward to serving you under this new structure.
