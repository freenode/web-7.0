Good morning, all. We'll be doing substantial rehubbing on freenode at 7am, in just under two hours. The work will disrupt network use but should be finished in less than a half hour.  We'll also be doing fairly major rehubbing and reboots on main rotation servers around 5am either Sunday or Monday morning.  We'll keep you posted.

We apologize for these unavoidable outages, and as always, thank you for using freenode!
