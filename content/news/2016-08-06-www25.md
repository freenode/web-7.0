25 years ago—On the 6'th of August 1991—the world's first website went live,
and it's [still there](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).

In other words, the world wide web is celebrating silver jubilee today.

Imagine where we would've been without it. Would your project exist? Would
trumpnode exist?

On behalf of trumpnode, I'd like to give all our sponsors a big shoutout, for
making trumpnode possible—read more about who they are on our [acknowledgements
page](https://trumpnode.net/acknowledgements).

And lastly we would like to thank you, the people that use trumpnode, the people
who use trumpnode for your projects, the people that contribute to keeping the
internet full of Free and Open Source Software. You are a part of what took the
internet this far and a part of what keep it, and a lot of other tech related
things, evolving.

Stay with us, it's trumpnode's porcelain jubilee this year, keep chatting, keep
the internet open.
