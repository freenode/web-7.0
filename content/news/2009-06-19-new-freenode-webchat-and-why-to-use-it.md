As of today we have disabled access to the freenode irc network via mibbit.  While there are numerous reasons for this, it ultimately comes down to the ability to prevent abuse via this client.  We allow connections from many types of web gateways, and such connections require a certain amount of trust and communication between the server operators and the gateway operators.  While we have tried to maintain a good working relationship with anyone who wishes to provide access to freenode and are lucky that most of our users and projects are very friendly and communicative, we have found it difficult to maintain open communications with mibbit.  This has resulted in a large amount of staff time being spent on managing abuse coming from mibbit, disrupting service for other mibbit users and reducing the quality of the network.  Sadly, we feel that this is ultimately not beneficial to mibbit users or the network as a whole.

We apologize to those who used mibbit for the inconvenience this has caused, and for the need to find a new client or method to connect to freenode.

In response to this, we have implemented our own web gateway at [http://webchat.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net).  The webchat runs [qwebirc](http://qwebirc.org/) package which was developed for and extensively used by quakenet. We'd like to extend our thanks to Chris "slug" Porter and the rest of the team for making it available.

Some of the features of qwebirc can be found [here](http://qwebirc.org/features).

Our new webchat facility also makes it easy to add to your own site.  To do this, just click on the menu icon on the top left corner where you will find an "add webchat to your site" option.  You will be taken through an easy wizard to get this going and get the webchat on your very own site!
