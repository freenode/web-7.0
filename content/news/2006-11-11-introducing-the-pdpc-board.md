It is with great pleasure that I can finally introduce the new board of directors for PDPC, the not-for-profit entity that runs freenode.

Following Rob "lilo" Levin's death earlier this year, the PDPC board has voted in new board members and are about to embark upon some exciting new tasks. The new board is as follows:



	
  * **David Levin**

	
  * **Chris Mills**

	
  * **Christel Dahlskjaer**

	
  * **Phil Stracchino**


With this new board come the new corporate officers for the PDPC: David Levin as President, Chris Mills as Treasurer, and Christel Dahlskjaer as Secretary.

Chris and Phil are both resuming their positions from the original board, with the newcomers being David, Rob's younger brother, and Christel.

The board also saw the resignation of Seth Schoen. We would like to thank Seth for the time he has invested in PDPC, and wish him luck in his future endeavours. We trust that we will be working closely with Seth in the future, although he no longer holds a position on the board.

With a new board in place we are moving forward again, both from a freenode perspective and with other PDPC projects. For those of you who have been awaiting your PDPC sponsor cloaks, I'd like to apologise for the delay and reassure you that we will start processing the backlog over the next few days.

I would also like to extend thanks to the excellent volunteers who staff the freenode network, for their support, energy and enthusiasm over the past few months, our amazing and generous sponsors and last but not least, the diverse and vibrant userbase that make freenode what it is. Thank you for using freenode and have a great day!

Questions can as always be directed to staff@freenode.net, or feel free to /msg christel or LoRez on IRC.

Christel Dahlskjaer
Head of Staff, freenode
