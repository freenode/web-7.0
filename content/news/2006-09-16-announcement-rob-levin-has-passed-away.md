On the 12th September Rob Levin, known to many as freenode's lilo, was hit by a car while riding his bike. He suffered head injuries and was in a coma. Rob was being treated at the Neuro Trauma Intensive Care Unit at a local hospital in Houston, Texas where he passed away on Sept 16th.

Our thoughts are with Rob and his family, and we ask that you respect their privacy during this difficult time.
