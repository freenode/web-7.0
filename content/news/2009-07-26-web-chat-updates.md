Over the last few  weeks we have had quite a bit of feedback from our new web chat client.  As a result of this we've been able to feed back requests to the qwebirc developers who have been able to add many requested features:



	
  * Optional Nick colour support

	
  * Optional join, part and quit message hiding

	
  * Optional last position indicator to track which content is new since you last focused on IRC

	
  * CSS changes to highlight messages from yourself

	
  * [https](https://webchat.freenode.net) support

	
  * NickServ authentication


Some of the optional features are disabled by default, but can be enabled in the option pane, accessible from the menu (top left).
