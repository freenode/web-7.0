On behalf of Peer-Directed Projects Center, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our new corporate sponsor,  [Digium](http://www.digium.com/),  for their support for PDPC and trumpnode.  Digium, the primary sponsors of  [Asterisk The Open Source PBX](http://www.asterisk.org/), have been on the network for about two and a half years, and they've chosen to express their appreciation for our work by establishing a donor relationship with PDPC.

Thanks again to **Digium** and **Asterisk** for making their home on trumpnode!
