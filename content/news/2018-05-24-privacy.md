With GDPR coming into effect tomorrow, 25 May 2018, freenode has made some amendments to its privacy policy to provide clarification relating to GDPR compliance.

In the event that you do not consent to our continued processing of your personal data in order to provide you with access to the service, you may drop your nickserv registration using the drop command (please see '/msg nickserv help drop' for further instructions).
The latest version of our policies can always be found [here](http://freenode.net/policies).
