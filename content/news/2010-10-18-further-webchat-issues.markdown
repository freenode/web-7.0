title: Further webchat issues
---

Unfortunately, it seems the box our webchat is on has decided to fall out with the Internet again. We're working on setting up a reserve instance which shouldn't be affected by this sort of issue in the future. When we have more details, we'll update this post. We're really sorry for the inconvenience this causes, and guarantee it will be less in future.
Update: The host's issues appear to have been resolved. We now also have a backup instance running which can easily be switched to in the event of downtime in the future.
