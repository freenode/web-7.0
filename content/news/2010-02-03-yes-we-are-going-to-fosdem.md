As every year, some of us will attend FOSDEM.

This year, you will be able to meat [czajkowski](http://identi.ca/czajkowski), kloeri, [RichiH](http://identi.ca/richih), SeJo and a FOSDEM-virgin: marienz (be gentle). If you have any praise, complaints, questions, spare beer or just want to connect a face to a name, you are more than welcome to poke us.
Hunt us down via IRC or the linked identi.ca pages and we will try to meet you.
