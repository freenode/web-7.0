It was the day before Christmas, when all across the network not a creature was stirring, not even a troll...

Another year is coming to a close, a year of FOSS, a year of collaboration, a year of getting to know exciting projects and contributors, a year plentiful in conferences and events. A year in which community was at the heart of everything freenode and the PDPC did.

I am sat here in a candle lit room that smells of Christmas spice whilst sipping eggnog and stealing a moment to myself to reflect... when I first started using freenode, the network had around 1200 users -- some years on we've passed 76,000. It is great to see so many projects make use of the service! The PDPC is doing some exciting stuff, FOSSCON was arranged for the second year running in 2011, FOSSEVENTS is still going strong and Geeknics are being held across the globe. Sometimes it is a bit daunting, everyone involved with freenode (and other PDPC projects) volunteer their time and skills to help the communities -- and whilst this is great, the volunteer roster isn't growing at a rate matching the increase in users. We will be doing another "Call for volunteers" in the New Year and we're looking to find some awesome people to add to the team.

On a more personal basis, I've had the pleasure of participating in some brilliant "real life" events this year - from the always brilliant [OGGCAMP](http://www.oggcamp.org), arranged by the amazing people behind the [Linux Outlaws](http://linuxoutlaws.org) and [Ubuntu UK podcasts](http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org). OGGCAMP is the sort of event which attracts "my sort of geek" -- people with which I really enjoy spending time and socialising and I am already looking forward to next years! I've also enjoyed a number of Ubuntu-UK events, from the recent release party to smaller happy hours to the rather interesting Christmas meal at Dans Le Noir, where we ate a surprise menu (consisting of glow in the dark scallops, ostrich and blue shark to name some items!) in complete darkness before wandering off to enjoy a few pints of ale. Now, this is where freenode communities are great -- I am an avid fan of the Ubuntu project, however, I have never used the distribution (though as a Debian user I am sure I'd get on with it just fine.. right?) but through freenode I have, over the years, come to know a lot of Ubuntu contributors and users, and over time discovered that these are people I really enjoy spending my time and people I am proud to call my friends! And I love their social events, they are a lot of fun! So thank you for letting me be a part of your community despite not really being "one of you" ;)

On the subject of freenode, communities and Christmas parties -- as freenode volunteers are scattered across the globe, few of us meet on a regular basis but we tend to try make an effort to get together for dinner and drinks at events such as fosdem. This year, we decided to have a Christmas party, surprisingly we ended up with 21 people attending, most of which had never met each other in person before. Our volunteers flew over from America and Europe and we all had a smashing weekend filled with good food, nice drink and much laughter. Thank you all for coming!

In 2012 I look forward to learning about more projects, old and new. I look forward to attending yet more conferences and meeting more of you in person! I look forward to another year together with our volunteers and our sponsors, and of course our users.

On which note I shall wrap this entry up, thank you for using freenode and wish you all a Merry Christmas!
