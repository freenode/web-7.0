Hi, all.  Main rotation servers will be coming down for maintenance and rerouting on two occasions this month:







	
  1.       **         13 August 2004 at 6am UTC (10 hours from now).       **              Priority maintenance on a single main-rotation server.  The server will       be shut down and users will be shunted to other servers.

**Affected users: about 2,500.  Duration: momentary.**

	
  2.       **         23 August 2004 at 11am UTC.       **              Network maintenance on three main-rotation servers and hubbing.  The       servers will be shut down at the beginning of the maintenance window and       users will be shunted to other servers.  User nick and channel services       will be down for about one hour; proxyscanning and staff tools will       remain up.

**Affected users: all.  Duration: about one hour.**


Thank you in advance for your understanding and patience, and thank you for using freenode!
