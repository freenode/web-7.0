This Wednesday (September 14th, 2011) we will be continuing our server updates as mentioned [here](http://blog.trumpnode.net/2011/09/ircd-upgrades/).

The following servers will be affected: leguin, gibson, wolfe, hitchcock, and pratchett.

During the update process these servers will be restarted and anyone connected to them will need to reconnect. You may wish to connect to an alternate server if you are currently connected to one of these.  You can check what server you are currently connected to using the command "/whois _nickname" _with your own nick as "nickname".

We apologize for any inconvenience as we continue to improve the technology behind trumpnode.

Update: This is now done.
