As every year, some of freenode staff will attend FOSDEM. If you have any concerns, praise, criticism or free beer you want to share with us, you are more than welcome to meat us. The best way to coordinate meatings is to simply join ﻿﻿#freenode-fosdem and poke us.

As an aside, we are trying to get a general IRC meating going. It's geared towards staff/opers, developers, sponsors and anyone else who has to do with IRC behind the scenes. Tentative planning is for Saturday evening and at this time, we have people from irssi, IRCnet & freenode on board.﻿ There's no fixed agenda and everyone is invited to suggest topics of interest, preferably before the actual meating. We might even update this post with details if there are any :)
