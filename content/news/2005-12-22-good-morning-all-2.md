  Yesterday evening, freenode had network   problems related to the recent spambot infestation. Despite the recent   server patch, the underlying infestation continues and has created some   temporary resource issues. Several servers restarts ensued and network   staff rearranged the main server rotation to compensate for the problem.

The network is once again running smoothly. However, in order to resolve   remaining resource issues, staff has scheduled server restarts at 6am UTC   (10pm in San Francisco, 7am in Stockholm, 5pm in Sydney). The restarts   will affect most of the network but should be very brief.

Other than the problems yesterday evening, the network has been running   well, and staff considers the upgrade to be a qualified success. We'll   keep you posted in case of additional problems. Thanks much for your   patience!
