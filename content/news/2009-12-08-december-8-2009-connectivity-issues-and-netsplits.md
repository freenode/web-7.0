As you are probably aware, we've been facing some fairly major splits today as there have been issues between some of our major hubs. We've rerouted these and are working on tracing down the cause of any other splits.  Please be aware, our staff are already hard at work on these issues and will resolve them as quickly as possible. Included here are 2 global notices about this matter.

[Global Notice] Hi all, we appear to be having some
connectivity issues with our main US hub, as a result of
this we are temporarily without  services, if this affects
your channel please contact staff in #freenode for
assistance. We're looking into the issues as we speak. Thank
you for your patience.

[Global Notice] Hi all, we're having some major issues with
connectivity at the DC hosting one of our hidden hubs, I'm
going to re-route around it,  which will cause about twice
as much noise as the splits already made. Apologies for the
inconvenience.

These and other issues are a large part of the reason for the upcoming migration to ircd-seven, and we still need your help in that regard.  We are still in need help testing the new ircd and working out the bugs.  If you would like to help out, have a look at [this ](http://blog.freenode.net/2009/11/testing-the-nets/)posting for information on how you can test the new ircd.

Thank you for using freenode, and have a great day!
