Short blog post this evening but an important one!



I suspect many of you rely on the SORBS DNS blacklists to help provide spamless emails.  Sadly infrastructure support is being withdrawn by the current providers leaving a significant void to effective spam handling.



I encourage you to read over the articles on  [http://www.au.sorbs.net/](http://www.au.sorbs.net/) and if at all possible offer assistance.



Thanks!
