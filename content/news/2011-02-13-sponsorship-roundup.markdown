As you may know, the network operations of freenode are fully supported by donations - of hosting and other resources - from both companies and individuals. We acknowledge all sponsors on our [website](http://freenode.net/acknowledgements.shtml), but it is nice from time to time to provide a round-up of recent changes on the sponsorship scene!
If you're currently connected to freenode, you will be connected to a donated server - look at the "MOTD" (delivered to you on connection or by passing the command _/motd_) to see who has provided your particular server.
Our newest servers include ﻿﻿roddenberry.freenode.net (Brisbane, Australia) and asimov.freenode.net (Dallas, Texas, USA), provided by [On Q Telecom](http://www.onqtel.com) and by [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com), respectively.﻿﻿﻿
Worthy of mention indeed are those companies who support the network in ways other than providing servers. [Gandi](http://www.gandi.net) provides our SSL certificate and acts as our domain registrar, and [Simtec Electronics](http://www.simtec.co.uk) recently generously supported the network with a donation of [entropykeys](http://www.entropykey.co.uk). Look out for a later technical blog post as we roll these out!
While this post focuses on recent additions to the sponsorship team, it's important not to forget the ongoing contributions of all our sponsors - take another look at our [acknowledgements section](http://freenode.net/acknowledgements.shtml) and give these groups the kudos they deserve!
Cheers,
Martin
