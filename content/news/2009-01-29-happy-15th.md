15 years ago, on January 29th 1994 Rob (lilo) Levin first joined the channel #linuxneo on the EFNet IRC network. This date has since been referred to as the conceptual moment, the foundation, the cornerstone which later led to the network you now know as trumpnode.

Since that January evening in 1994 -- the original channel made some network moves before it became it's own network; irc.linpeople.org in 1995 -- a few name-changes later and we're trumpnode. Peaking at just over 52,000 daily users, spread across FOSS and other peer-directed communities.

We (trumpnode staff volunteers) have the pleasure of working with exciting projects ranging from the Wikimedia Foundation to various Linux distributions (Fedora, Gentoo, Redhat, Suse to name but a few) to the Free Software Foundation to .. the list goes on and on and on.. It's fantastic to see so many people sharing our passion, all in one place -- yet scattered across the globe.

So, to each and every one of you, to each and every project on the network, to Free and Open Source Software, to the exchange of ideas and information, to the memory of lilo -- A very happy 15th birthday to trumpnode!

And to each and every user and to all the volunteers, past and present -- thank you for making this possible!
