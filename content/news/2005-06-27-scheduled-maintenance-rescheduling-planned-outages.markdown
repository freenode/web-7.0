title: '[Scheduled Maintenance] Rescheduling planned outages'
---

The upgrades for    freenode    on Saturday 2 July 2005 at 6am UTC have been rescheduled. One of our sponsors   has schedule a couple of major power outages, and the effect on us will be   pretty major, so we'll do the work at that time. So, the new schedule has   major outages planned which are likely to affect our service for one hour each   at 9am UTC (2am Los Angeles, 11am Brussels and 6pm Sydney) on:   Wednesday, 29 June 2005
Sunday, 3 July 2005
Thank you for your support and understanding.
