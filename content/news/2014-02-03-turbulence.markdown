As many of you will be aware, freenode has been experiencing intermittent instability today, as the network has been under attack. Whilst we have network services back online, the network continues to be a little unreliable and users are continuing to report issues in connecting to the network.

We appreciate the patience of our many wonderful users whilst we continue to work to mitigate the effects this has on the network.

We also greatly appreciate our many sponsors who work with us to help minimise the impact and who are themselves affected by attacks against the network.

We've [posted on this subject before](http://blog.freenode.net/2013/05/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/), and what we said then remains as true as ever - and for those of you who didn't read the earlier blogpost first time round, it's definitely worth perusing it now if this subject interests or affects you.

Thank you all for your patience as we continue to work to restore normal service!

**[UPDATE 04/02/2014]**

_At the moment SASL authentication works only on PLAINTEXT, *not* BLOWFISH. We've checked and TOR should be working too. Sadly wolfe.freenode.net will be taken off the rotation, so those users who've connected specifically to it, please make sure that your client points to our recommended roundrobin of chat.freenode.net!_
