Title: Resetting your password
---

If you have forgotten the password for your NickServ account, you can send a
password reset mail to the email address you used when you registered your
account using:

    /msg NickServ SENDPASS youraccountnamehere

You should receive an email at the email address you registered with, containing
a command with a password reset key, which you can use on IRC to reset your
password.

If you do not receive the email, please check your spam folders etc.

If you already have an outstanding password reset mail, you cannot send another,
but you can contact freenode staff in #freenode (or find them on /stats p) for
assistance.
