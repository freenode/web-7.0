Title: Configuring SASL for mIRC
---
mIRC added built-in SASL support in version 7.48, released April 2017. The below instructions were written for version 7.51, released September 2017. Earlier versions of mIRC have unofficial third-party support for SASL, which is not documented here. freenode strongly recommends using the latest available version of your IRC client so that you are up-to-date with security fixes.

1. In the File menu, click Select Server...
2. In the Connect -> Servers section of the mIRC Options window, select the correct server inside the Freenode folder, then click Edit
3. In the "Login Method" dropdown, select "SASL (/CAP)"
4. In the second "Password" box at the bottom of the window, enter your NickServ username, then a colon, then your NickServ password. For example, "dax:hunter2"
5. Click the OK button
