Title: Configuring SASL for Textual
---
Textual is a lightweight IRC client for Mac OS X. Textual supports SASL out of the box without any additional scripts or plugins.

To set up SASL you need to know your NickServ account name, which you can find with /msg NickServ INFO.

To set up a new server with SASL:

1. Go to the Server menu and select "Add Server"
2. Set up freenode as you would normally, with the hostname chat.freenode.net
3. Go to the "Identity" tab
4. Fill in your nickname, then put your NickServ account name in the "Username" field and your NickServ password in the "Personal Password" field
5. Save and connect

For an existing server:

1. Go to the Server menu and select "Server Properties"
2. Go to the "Identity" tab
3. Fill in your nickname, then put your NickServ account name in the "Username" field and your NickServ password in the "Personal Password" field
4. Save and reconnect
