Title: Configuring SASL for Ambassador
---
In order to use SASL in the [Ambassador](https://github.com/Ascrod/ambassador) client, you simply have to go to Ambassador --> Preferences on the menu bar, and check the "Use SASL Authentication" checkbox. Make sure your nickname matches the nickname(s) you have registered on freenode.

The next time you connect, the client will prompt you for a password, which you can save in your password manager.

If everything has been configured correctly, you should see the message `SASL authentication successful`.
