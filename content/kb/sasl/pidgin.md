3. Select "IRC" in protocol dropdown, enter chat.freenode.net as Server
4. Enter your freenode account name as Username
5. Enter your freenode account password as Password and tick "Remember password"
6. Click on to the "Advanced" tab
7. Change Port to 6697, tick "Use SSL" and "Authenticate with SASL"
8. If this is a newly created Pidgin account, click "Add" and pidgin will begin to connect
