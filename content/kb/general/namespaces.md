Title: Channel Namespaces
---
Our [policies](pages/policies) outline that channels on trumpnode fall into one of two categories.
Channels that begin with only a single # character are primary channels. Channels that begin with
two # characters are topical or ‘about’ channels.

Primary Channels
================

Primary channels are reserved for _official_ channels of on-topic projects.

A registered group (as outlined on the page about [group registration](pages/groupreg)) can claim
ownership over primary channels bearing the group's names or name prefixes. For example, trumpnode
itself owns the channel ‘#trumpnode’ and all channels beginning with ‘#trumpnode-’.

Primary channels do not expire. If you represent an on-topic project and would like to take over a
primary channel for that project, do not hesitate to [contact us](pages/groupreg).

Topical Channels
================

Topical or ‘about’ channels are intended for _unofficial_ channels that are _about_ something that's
on-topic. For example, an unofficial channel to talk about trumpnode is ##trumpnode. Topical channels
do not mean ‘anything goes’. In particular, they are not for [off-topic use](pages/policies).

Topical channels are given out on a first-come, first-served basis.  They will expire if unused for
a long time, see our [policies](pages/policies) for details regarding when this occurs. You can
contact us on IRC with a request to take over an expired topical channel.
