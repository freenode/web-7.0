Title: User and project cloaks
---

There are two types of cloak which can be set on accounts on freenode; both
replace the hostname/IP displayed when you are connected (but only when you're
identified to NickServ—see below).

There are also gateway cloaks, which are automatically applied if you're
connecting from certain providers, gateways or web IRC clients, whether or not
you are identified to NickServ, and which override unaffiliated cloaks.


Project cloaks
==============

Project cloaks typically take the form `project/role/user`, for instance
`freenode/staff/bigpresh` (though some take other forms). They are designed to
demonstrate that the user is connected to a project in some way. Different
projects use cloaks for various roles—some only use them for their core
team, some will assign user cloaks as well.

Project cloaks can only be requested by a registered group contact of an
already [registered group](pages/groupreg)—they should contact a member of
freenode staff to request that a user be given a project cloak.


Unaffiliated cloaks
===================

Unaffiliated cloaks for users take the form `unaffiliated/accountname`. They
indicate that you are not affiliated with any specific project on freenode.
They can also help obscure your IP from casual observers to a certain
degree—but see the weaknesses section below.

Bots can also be cloaked to indicate their owner—unaffiliated bot cloaks
take the form `unaffiliated/owneraccountname/bot/botaccountname`.


Gateway cloaks
==============

If you are connected via a gateway which sets a gateway cloak (for instance, our
webchat, or KiwiIRC, or some bouncer/shell providers) you will receive an
automatic gateway cloak—for instance `gateway/web/freenode/ip.1.2.3.4`—these
gateway cloaks override unaffiliated cloaks, but do not override project cloaks.

There are also gateway cloaks which may denote that the host the user is coming
from is recognised as a large-scale NAT gateway (where the public IP is being
shared by many individual customers behind it) or conferences, where many users
are at one location temporarily.


Cloaks do not effectively hide your IP
======================================

Cloaks can help obscure your IP address/hostname from casual observers, but
should *not* be relied upon for that purpose, as they are not reliable:

 - Connecting before identifying to NickServ (or whilst services are
   unavailable due to a netsplit or maintenance) will show your uncloaked
   IP/hostname. [Authenticating with SASL](/kb/answer/sasl) avoids this if 
   configured to abort the connection on authentication failure.
 - Connecting via a gateway (for instance, the webchat) will override
   unaffiliated cloaks (see the "gateway cloaks" section above)
 - Due to the nature of IRC services, there are some tricks which can cause
   services to reveal a cloaked user's IP/hostname.
 - Accepting a DCC chat/file transfer session, or clicking a link someone sends
   you could reveal your IP to them

For these reasons, we advise you to consider cloaks as only very basic
protection from casual observers, and a way to stop your IP/hostname being
passively logged in most cases, but caution that they cannot be relied upon to
hide your IP/hostname robustly—if you want that, you should consider an [IRC
bouncer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC_bouncer),
[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) or [our Tor hidden
service](/kb/answer/chat#accessing-freenode-via-tor)).

Do consider, however, just how much you need to hide your IP address; it's
disclosed routinely during normal Internet usage—for instance, every website
you visit will necessarily see your IP address, unless you are using a VPN or
Tor. Many, many users happily use IRC for decades, never hiding their IP
address, and do not have any problems.

To reiterate, the primary purpose of cloaks is to show your project
affiliation, or lack thereof. Hiding your IP is not their primary purpose, and
they cannot be fully relied upon to do that.

Also, even when you are cloaked, you will see your own IP if you /whois
yourself.


Requesting a cloak
==================

Once you've read and understood the above, if you would like an unaffiliated
cloak, please drop in to #freenode or speak to a member of the staff team. Note
that cloaks are a privilege, and staff have the right to deny that privilege to
users if they deem necessary.

For project cloaks, a registered GC for the project needs to contact staff to
request the cloak be added to the desired user.
