Title: General Expectations for Conduct
---
In addition to the general [policies](pages/policies) governing behaviour when
using freenode, we strongly encourage all participants to adopt the [channel
guidelines](pages/changuide) and [philosophy](pages/philosophy) to help keep
the network a friendly and productive place.

In particular, we would urge all users to keep the following in mind:

- We expect all users to act in good faith at all times, and this includes
  assuming the same of others. Where another user's behaviour admits several
  interpretations, work on the basis of the most charitable one until you have
  strong evidence to the contrary.
- freenode aims to be welcoming, inclusive, and non-discriminatory and we 
  encourage everyone to be tolerant and respectful of others.
