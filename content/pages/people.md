Title: The People
---
The freenode project is run entirely by volunteers. All of the current
volunteers came to the project through involvement with one or more of the
projects that use freenode.

The organisational structure of the freenode project can be split roughly into
three teams, each with a designated representative or representatives, elected
by the respective teams. In addition there is a representative of staff, who
coordinates the project as a whole.

- **tomaw** is representative of staff.
- **e** is representative of the development team, coordinating development of
  the software that we use to run the network, as well as web, tool and bot
  development.
- **glguy** is representative of the infrastructure team, coordinating the
  technical side of network operations to ensure things continue to run in a
  usable fashion and that we have the right hardware and server platforms in
  place to provide the services we want.
- **Fuchs** is representative of the projects and community team, coordinating
  group registrations, fostering a good relationship with communities using our
  services and communication via our various public channels.

However, decisions affecting the future direction of freenode are taken by staff
as a group. The project benefits greatly from the ongoing support and enthusiasm
from its contributors and volunteers, both official and unofficial, and is
grateful for the time and efforts invested in the project by past and present
volunteers. The freenode project keeps a keen eye out for individuals who may
provide a good fit to the existing volunteer base and we periodically recruit
existing participants who have made a strong positive impression and we believe
would be a good fit on the staff team.

If you are looking for freenode volunteers on the freenode network you can find
us in `#freenode` where we are always happy to have a chat or you can use
`/stats p` to find volunteers that are immediately available.
