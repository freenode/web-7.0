Title: freenode #live!
---
freenode #live is a community-focused live event designed to **build** and **strengthen** relationships between Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) developers and users. freenode live seeks to raise awareness of and promote FOSS alternatives to proprietary software. Facilitating face-to-face interaction, creative workshops, talks and think tanks, freenode live will bring developers and users together in a nurturing and dynamic environment stimulating the free exchange of ideas and information while fostering cross-project collaboration and dialogue for innovation. 

The inaugural freenode #live conference takes place at At-Bristol in Bristol, UK from Saturday 28 to Sunday 29 October 2017. Both days will include talks and workshops, and we look forward to seeing you at this community-focused gathering.

[Tickets are now on sale](https://freenode.live/conference/fn-live17/register/new) and we are taking [submissions for the call for participation](https://freenode.live/conference/fn-live17/program/proposal/new) and look forward to receiving yours.

We will be making every effort to ensure that freenode #live is as inclusive an event as is possible and we encourage the minorities within our community to attend and submit proposals.

The freenode #live venue is fully wheelchair-accessible and there is step-free access from the street, car parks and to all venue spaces.

We are keen to ensure that freenode #live is welcoming and inclusive of all, including the next generation of geeks. With that in mind, we will be providing a crèche staffed by qualified childminders during conference hours. If you wish to use the crèche or book your child onto a scheduled tour of At-Bristol and the Aquarium, please do let us know in good time as spaces are limited.

Children will be welcome at all appropriate conference events including in the audience during talks.

If you are breastfeeding your baby, you are welcome to feed your baby whenever and wherever you like, including during talks. freenode #live will provide a friendly and welcoming environment for parents and children.
