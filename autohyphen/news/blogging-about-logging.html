    <div class="art-body">
    <p>Af­ter <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/30/will-irseek-have-a-chilling-effect-on-irc-chat/">this</a> re­cent ar­ti­cle on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">techcrunch.com</a> many of our users have con­tact­ed freen­ode staff to ex­press their con­cern, shock, sur­prise and un­ease that IRseeK have for some time now been op­er­at­ing covert clients in var­i­ous chan­nels on freen­ode (and oth­er IRC Net­works) log­ging all com­mu­ni­ca­tion and pub­lish­ing it on their web­site.</p>
<p>We, freen­ode staff, are also sur­prised, not to men­tion rather up­set, that this com­pa­ny has cho­sen to com­plete­ly ig­nore our poli­cies and per­form ac­tions which our users see as an in­va­sion of their pri­va­cy. While we have con­tact­ed B &amp; C Ad­vanced So­lu­tions, the com­pa­ny be­hind IRseeK, to re­quest that they dis­con­tin­ue unau­tho­rized log­ging on freen­ode and also that they re­move any pub­lished logs, we have un­for­tu­nate­ly had to take the ad­di­tion­al step of block­ing new tor con­nec­tions while we pur­sue the mat­ter fur­ther. The log­ging bots pri­mar­i­ly con­nect through tor, seem to have no dis­tin­guish­ing char­ac­ter­is­tics that we can iden­ti­fy, and so far the com­pa­ny has not been will­ing to re­move them vol­un­tar­i­ly. We are cur­rent­ly re­mov­ing the bots as we see them, and if you do spot a client you be­lieve may be a IRseeK log­ging bot, please do let staff know and they will look into whether the client needs to be re­moved from the net­work. To all le­git­i­mate tor users out there, I apol­o­gise for the in­con­ve­nience caused and hope to have nor­mal ser­vice re­stored as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
<p>Our web­site clear­ly states our poli­cies on this top­ic, which have been pub­lished for sev­er­al years. For those who haven't read them re­cent­ly, I quote one of the rel­e­vant sec­tions:</p>
<p><em><strong>"If you're con­sid­er­ing pub­lish­ing chan­nel logs,       think it through.     </strong>          The freen­ode net­work is an in­ter­ac­tive     en­vi­ron­ment.  Even on pub­lic chan­nels, most users don't weigh their     com­ments with the idea that they'll be en­shrined in per­pe­tu­ity. For that     rea­son, few par­tic­i­pants pub­lish logs.</em></p>
<p><em>If you're pub­lish­ing logs on an on­go­ing ba­sis, your chan­nel top­ic should     re­flect that fact. Be sure to pro­vide a way for users to make com­ments     with­out log­ging, and get per­mis­sion from the chan­nel own­ers be­fore you     start.  If you're think­ing of "anonymiz­ing" your logs (re­mov­ing     in­for­ma­tion that iden­ti­fies the spe­cif­ic users), be aware that it's     dif­fi­cult to do it well—replies and gen­er­al con­text of­ten pro­vide     iden­ti­fy­ing in­for­ma­tion which is hard to fil­ter.</em></p>
<p><em>If you just want to pub­lish a sin­gle con­ver­sa­tion, be care­ful to get     per­mis­sion from each par­tic­i­pant. Pro­vide as much con­text as you can.      Avoid the temp­ta­tion to pub­lish or dis­trib­ute logs with­out per­mis­sion in     or­der to por­tray some­one in a bad light. The rep­u­ta­tion you save will     most like­ly be your own.              "</em></p>
<p>And this per­haps, is where I feel that IRseeK has gone hor­ri­bly wrong. I be­lieve that this could have be­come a pop­u­lar ser­vice had it been done in a way which pro­motes choice -- op­er­at­ing on an op­t-in ba­sis could very well have meant that a lot of chan­nel own­ers would have cho­sen to re­quest an IRseeK log­ging bot in their chan­nel so that logs could be ref­er­enced and looked at lat­er.</p>
<p>How­ev­er, cur­rent­ly there is no way to op­t-in, or even to opt out. The bots aren't eas­i­ly iden­ti­fi­able and you're not aware that they are present in your chan­nel. Ide­al­ly, I would have liked to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log­ging bots clear­ly iden­ti­fi­able as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log­ging of chan­nels oc­cur­ring only at the chan­nel own­er­s' re­quest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chan­nels that opt in to this ser­vice dis­play­ing, in a way which is vis­i­ble to all cur­rent and new users of the chan­nel, that the chan­nel is be­ing logged and the logs made pub­li­cal­ly avail­able on the web. The chan­nel top­ic and on-join no­tice could eas­i­ly be used to this ef­fect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy method to re­move log­ging bots from a chan­nel should it join in er­ror or a chan­nel own­er de­cide that they no longer wish their chan­nel to be logged.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Per­haps, in this re­gard, they could have tak­en a leaf out of <a href="http://www.cia.vc">CIA's</a> book and be­come a lot more pop­u­lar in the process.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest sur­prise is that the peo­ple be­hind IRseeK de­fend their ac­tions and be­lieve that they are en­tire­ly with­in their rights to do what they do in the man­ner that they do it. Leav­ing our guide­lines aside for a mo­ment, what irks me is this: freen­ode caters pri­mar­i­ly to peo­ple from the FOSS com­mu­ni­ties, peo­ple to whom choice and free­dom are im­por­tant. For us, pro­vid­ing a ser­vice such as freen­ode to our com­mu­ni­ty is im­por­tant; our users give a lot, we share code, knowl­edge, hints, frus­tra­tions, laugh­ter..  and we like to give back in the lit­tle way we can. It then does not feel com­fort­able or at all right to have some­one in­trude upon our pri­va­cy, sneak­ing into the cir­cle and ob­serv­ing with the sin­gu­lar aim of pub­li­cis­ing our con­ver­sa­tions en­tire­ly with­out our knowl­edge or con­sent. By tak­ing the route that they did, IRseeK has tak­en away our free­dom and our choice. They have forced some­thing down on us and in the process soured and poi­soned a com­mu­ni­ty which thrives on trust and col­lab­o­ra­tion. It has cre­at­ed a bad at­mos­phere and made a lot of peo­ple un­com­fort­able.</p>
<p>I am re­al­ly sor­ry that this prob­lem has reached our net­work, and I am re­al­ly sor­ry for the way it has af­fect­ed our com­mu­ni­ty. I am also sor­ry for the way in which IRseeK choose to per­form their ac­tions, and sor­ri­er still that we did not catch it soon­er.</p>
<p>I sin­cere­ly hope that IRseeK will ho­n­our our re­quest to stop at­tempt­ing to log chan­nels on freen­ode with­out the chan­nel own­er's ex­plic­it per­mis­sion, and I also hope that they will ho­n­our our re­quest to re­move logs al­ready in their sys­tem.</p>
<p>Last­ly, I would like to wish IRseeK well, and I hope that you re-­con­sid­er your ap­proach. I be­lieve that if done prop­er­ly, what you have could be turned into a re­spectable ser­vice which would be used by and ap­pre­ci­at­ed by a lot of peo­ple.</p>
<p>As I said, we have got­ten in touch with the peo­ple be­hind IRseeK and they have asked to have un­til this sun­day (to­mor­row) to re­spond. I will give you an up­date when we hear back from them and know which way the tide is turn­ing.</p>
<p>For now, thank you for us­ing freen­ode and have a great day!</p>
