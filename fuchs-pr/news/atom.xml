blogged&lt;/a&gt; about resurrecting Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, Tor users can once more connect to freenode over Tor; the hidden
service address is&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following an embarrassingly long period of no Tor support, we &lt;a href="resurrecting-tor"&gt;recently
blogged&lt;/a&gt; about resurrecting Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, Tor users can once more connect to freenode over Tor; the hidden
service address is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;freenodeok2gncmy.onion
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden service requires SASL authentication, as before. In addition, due to
the abuse that led Tor access to be disabled in the first place, we have
unfortunately had to add another couple of restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must log in using SASL's &lt;code&gt;EXTERNAL&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE&lt;/code&gt; (more
    below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you log out while connected via Tor, you will not be able to log in without
    reconnecting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't set up the requisite SASL authentication, we recommend SASL
EXTERNAL. You'll need to generate a client certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 1000 -nodes -out freenode.pem -keyout freenode.pem
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and consult your IRC client's documentation to find out how to use it to
connect. Connect to freenode over TLS on the plain Internet and &lt;code&gt;/msg NickServ
CERT ADD&lt;/code&gt; to authorise it to your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll then want to tell your client to try the &lt;code&gt;EXTERNAL&lt;/code&gt; mechanism. We lack
comprehensive documentation for this, but it's a feature in most modern
clients—check their docs for instructions for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's currently not possible to register an account for use with Tor without
connecting at least once over the Internet. We're investigating our options, and
would like to provide a solution to this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Resurrecting tor-sasl</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/resurrecting-tor" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-05T16:09:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-05T16:09:00+01:00</updated><author><name>edk</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2016-09-05:/news/resurrecting-tor</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many of you will no doubt be aware, freenode used to run a Tor hidden
service, providing anonymous access to the network. Unfortunately, this had to
be disabled due to concerns about abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regret that it has taken some time to resolve this issue but we are now
almost ready to deploy some software updates that will allow us to re-enable the
gateway. We've made one important change: password-based SASL authentication is
disabled over the Tor gateway, so you'll need to generate a client certificate
and add its fingerprint (&lt;code&gt;/msg NickServ CERT ADD&lt;/code&gt;) over a regular connection
before connecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect the occasional interruption—even if nothing exciting happens, we still
have a few configuration things to take care of. The test network may be reset,
rolled back, or shut down at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your patience, and thank you in advance for helping to bring Tor
access back as fast as possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Happy Birthday to the World Wide Web</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/www25" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-06T22:06:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-08-06T22:06:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Swant</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2016-08-06:/news/www25</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;25 years ago—On the 6'th of August 1991—the world's first website went live,

staff resignations, and we feel we owe you all both an explanation and an
apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the explanation: in short, it's become clear over recent months that
freenode has lost its way somewhat, when compared to the ideals and goals that
we were created with. A growing sense of disillusionment amongst those of us who
remember the olden days, when we were far more friendly, approachable and
engaged in the communities we were set up to serve, has recently come to a head.
Naturally, when some of these people decided they could no longer continue with
the way things had become, it was time for us to think long and hard about what
had gone wrong and what we should do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, to the apology. We're uncomfortably aware that freenode was set up with
the strong idea that the projects and communities which use it should be the
first, and often the only, priority. We've lost sight of that, and we're sorry.
We'll be doing our best, from now on, to get back in touch with the ideals that
made freenode such a great place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many of you have been asking questions about the recent rash of high-profile

&lt;p&gt;This won't be easy for us, as we've got years of bad habits to break, but
hopefully you should start seeing some improvements in the coming months. If you
see anything that we're not doing that would help your communities, please tell
us and we'll try our best to find a way to make it happen. You might see a bit
of chaos or inconsistency while we try to find our way around again, but please
try to bear with us and we hope you'll see things get better in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, because we're conscious that a lack of clarity around our
leadership structure has not helped matters, we've decided to set out
unambiguously how the staff management structure will work from now on. Our
activities and operations will be split roughly into four areas, each with a
designated lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mist is head of staff, and in charge of day to day network operations and general staff issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kloeri is head of infrastructure, in charge of making sure that the network continues to run in a usable fashion and that we have the right hardware and server platforms in place to provide the services we want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spb is head of development, in charge of the software platforms that we use to run the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christel is head of projects and communities, and also the overall project lead in charge of the other three heads. She'll be trying to make sure that we get back the levels of engagement that we once had with the projects we're here to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four, together, will take any decisions that affect the future direction
of freenode. While they each have their own area of focus, feel free to contact
any of us about any issues you may have -- we try to keep an open (virtual) door
policy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The New Policies</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/the-new-policies" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-19T13:11:52+00:00</published><updated>2016-02-19T13:11:52+00:00</updated><author><name>spb</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2016-02-19:/news/the-new-policies</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the several problems that's become obvious in recent times is that we  have too many policies, they're often not consistent with each other, and we've spent too much time and effort wondering whether something, which is obviously the right thing to do, fits with our published policy. With that in mind, the following stripped-back set of policies will apply in future, with the intention that we can set out a simple set of baselines and apply common sense on top of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nickname ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicknames are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, to the first person
who registers the name with NickServ. However, we expect users to act in good
faith and reserve the right to remove a nickname registration where we believe
that this has not been the case.
&lt;strong&gt;Nickname and account registrations expire ten weeks after they are last used.
For nicknames, 'used' means that you were using the nickname while logged in to
the account which owns it. For accounts, 'used' means that you logged in to the
account, regardless of the nickname you used to do so. Nicknames which are the
primary account name only expire when the entire account is expired.&lt;/strong&gt;
In some cases, such as for very old accounts, we may, at our discretion, extend
the expiry time of a nickname or account. We will not normally do this beyond 15
weeks past the last use.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the several problems that's become obvious in recent times is that we  have too many policies, they're often not consistent with each other, and we've spent too much time and effort wondering whether something, which is obviously the right thing to do, fits with our published policy.

weeks past the last use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nicknames and accounts, including but not limited to some of those owned by
current or former network staff, do not expire at all. These accounts can be
identified by the 'Hold' flag in their NickServ info output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicknames and accounts which are expired will not automatically be dropped.
Please contact network staff if you would like to take over an expired nickname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels on freenode fall into one of two categories. Primary channels, which
begin with a single # character, are reserved for on-topic projects. If you'd
like to take over one of these channels, then you'll need to be associated in
some way with the project in question. Topical, or 'about' channels, begin with
two # characters, and these are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis to
the first person who registers it with ChanServ. As with nicknames, however, we
reserve the right to remove or alter registrations where we believe they have
not been made in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary channels do not expire with inactivity, though they can be claimed at
any time by a representative of an on-topic project with the appropriate name.
Topical channels expire after 60 days in which no user on the access list for
the channel has joined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-topic Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freenode's primary goal is to encourage and foster the development and use of
free and open source software projects and other peer-directed communities
producing broadly licensed creative output. Any project falling under this broad
description is likely to be considered on-topic for the purposes of primary
channel naming and other project services which we may provide, but individual
decisions may be made at the discretion of staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off-topic Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect all users of the network, whether affiliated with a project or not, to
act in good faith and in accordance with both their local laws and those
applicable where freenode operates. Use of freenode and its facilities is a
privilege, not a right, and may be withdrawn where we believe that this has not
been the case.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Services database purge</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/services-database-purge" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-18T08:58:13+00:00</published><updated>2015-09-18T08:58:13+00:00</updated><author><name>mrmist</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2015-09-18:/news/services-database-purge</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On or around Friday, October 2nd, we shall be cleaning up the services database.

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to go into the details here, as they have been explained by the GNOME project over at &lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/groupon/"&gt;http://www.gnome.org/groupon/&lt;/a&gt; and the GNOME folk are in a much better position than me to provide more detailed information on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If each of us donated just ONE DOLLAR to the GNOME project they would cover the anticipated legal costs AND have some spare change leftover for a pint when the proceedings conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you do not use GNOME, please consider helping them out. This is bigger than just GNOME and I think would be fantastic if the FOSS communities could drum together to support our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Due to the controversial nature of PayPal, GNOME is now also offering &lt;a href="https://www.gnome.org/friends/other-ways-to-donate"&gt; other ways to donate &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update #2: According to the Groupon blog and &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/11/11/groupon-gnome-foundation-trademark-war/"&gt;this article over at Engadget &lt;/a&gt;Groupon has issued the following statement: "Groupon is a strong and consistent supporter of the open source community, and our developers are active contributors to a number of open source projects. We've been communicating with the Foundation for months to try to come to a mutually satisfactory resolution, including alternative branding options, and we're happy to continue those conversations. Our relationship with the open source community is more important to us than a product name. And if we can't come up with a mutually acceptable solution, we'll be glad to look for another name."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that this means that the trademarks filed will be retracted and that the GNOME project can go about business as usual. I am certain they will be releasing a statement with further details before long.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Atheme 7.2 and freenode</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/atheme-7-2-and-freenode" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-08T23:18:51+00:00</published><updated>2014-11-08T23:18:51+00:00</updated><author><name>tomaw</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2014-11-08:/news/atheme-7-2-and-freenode</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SASL mechanism DH-BLOWFISH has been removed. People using it
can connect via SSL and use PLAIN or upgrade to ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE.
Details of how to do so are &lt;a href="https://github.com/atheme/ecdsatool"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://freenode.net/sasl/"&gt;our SASL page&lt;/a&gt; will be updated with the relevant documentation soonish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to connect to testnet at testnet.freenode.net Port 9002 for cleartext, and 9003 for SSL. Bear in mind, the database is a couple weeks old, so changes you've recently made on the production network may not be mirrored on the testnet network. Various amounts of staff should be idling in #freenode on testnet at all times, please feel free to poke us with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now, if you are having difficulties accessing your account, you can generate your own password reset e-mail using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/msg NickServ SENDPASS &amp;lt;account&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command will only work with an offline account (i.e. it won't work if a client is logged into your account via NickServ), and should obviously only be used on an account that you believe is yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be keeping an eye on how this feature is used, and may retain it permanently if it proves to be helpful and non-harmful!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Server Issues: Update</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/server-issues-update" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-15T21:27:44+00:00</published><updated>2014-10-15T21:27:44+00:00</updated><author><name>Pricey</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2014-10-15:/news/server-issues-update</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on our &lt;a href="http://blog.freenode.net/2014/09/server-issues-2/"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, we have continued to investigate the compromise of freenode infrastructure, aided by our sponsors in addition to experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NCC's support has been invaluable in aiding us in further securing our infrastructure, and we have already made significant changes to ensure that it is more resilient against further attacks. Our investigation into the compromise is ongoing and we will provide further updates as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, if you haven't updated your password, we would advise you do so as some traffic may have been sniffed. Simply "/msg nickserv set password newpasshere" and don't forget to update your client's saved password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we endeavour to provide a robust service, it is worth bearing in mind that no computer system is ever perfectly secure and many are inevitably breached. For this reason we do not suggest relying entirely on freenode (or any infrastructure) to protect sensitive data, and encourage our users to take further steps (e.g. unique passwords per service, encryption) as part of a defence in depth strategy to safeguard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are extremely grateful to NCC in addition to our many other sponsors for their assistance and continued support. Without the ongoing support of our generous sponsors and wonderful infrastructure team, freenode would quite literally not have a network!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be continuing to work with our sponsors in addition to other relevant authorities regarding this breach and any further incidents.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
