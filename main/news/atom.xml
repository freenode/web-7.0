The new structure will be slightly more compact, based on 3 main teams and team
internal roles. Decisions affecting all of freenode will be taken by staff as a
whole, while specific tasks are mostly taken care of by the corresponding teams
and their members. You can find out more about the teams and their area of
expertise under &lt;a href="/people"&gt;the people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are interesting times ahead, collaborating with our colleagues from
&lt;a href="https://www.oftc.net"&gt;OFTC&lt;/a&gt; we will switch to a new, tailored ircd
called solanum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed information on this and how you can test it and help out will follow in
a separate blog post soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have changed the organisational structure of freenode a bit.

broadly licensed, easy to access code, information and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Changes to realnames of matrix.org bridged users</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/matrix-bridge-realname" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-21T20:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-21T20:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jess</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2021-01-21:/news/matrix-bridge-realname</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://matrix.org/"&gt;matrix.org&lt;/a&gt; runs a bridge (matrix-appservice-irc) from
their Matrix homeserver to freenode that allow Matrix users from any
homeserver that federates with matrix.org to join channels on freenode and
intermingle with the normal IRC userbase. These users have their Matrix User
Id (username and homeserver, e.g. &lt;code&gt;@jess:freenode.net&lt;/code&gt;) put in the realname
field of their IRC connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the need to differentiate users by which homeserver they are using
has arisen for multiple reasons, and we've worked with the matrix.org bridge
operators to better format Matrix User Ids to suit the limited space provided
by IRC realnames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realnames pose a slight problem for this usage; the maximum length for a
Matrix User Id is 255 characters, whereas the maximum length for an IRC
realname is 50 characters and things longer than that get truncated, which
means if people have a Matrix username of 50 characters, it will truncate off
the entirety of their homeserver.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://matrix.org/"&gt;matrix.org&lt;/a&gt; runs a bridge (matrix-appservice-irc) from

means if people have a Matrix username of 50 characters, it will truncate off
the entirety of their homeserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution we came up with for this has been to reverse the order of
username and homeserver, and then reverse the order of domain name parts and
truncate that at 30 characters, which means the most significant parts of a
homeserver's domain name comes at the start of a realname. For example,
&lt;code&gt;@jess:freenode.net&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;net.freenode:jess&lt;/code&gt;. If a homeserver is truncated
to 30 characters, a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is appended prior to the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; -
&lt;code&gt;@jess:subdomaaaaaaaaaain.freenode.net&lt;/code&gt; would become
&lt;code&gt;net.freenode.subdomaaaaaaaaaai&amp;gt;:jess&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to extend deep gratitude to the operators of the matrix.org bridge
for handling and implementing our change request quickly to suit a
contemporary need, and we'd like to remind users that they can message staff
at any time if they have any questions about the above changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Changes to ChanServ regarding cloaks</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/chanserv-cloak-changes" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-28T17:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-28T17:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>edk</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2020-11-28:/news/chanserv-cloak-changes</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;freenode offers &lt;a href="/kb/answer/cloaks"&gt;cloaks&lt;/a&gt; to our users, which replace one's

managing a channel. However, if you need assistance with something that these

&lt;p&gt;While bans against IP addresses continue to apply to cloaked users, we intend to
revise this behaviour in the future due to its privacy implications.&lt;/p&gt;

we are excited to announce that freenode is moving to a new &lt;a href="https://kiwiirc.com/"&gt;Kiwi IRC&lt;/a&gt;
based solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change will occur during this weekend (June 22nd / 23rd).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

we are excited to announce that freenode is moving to a new &lt;a href="https://kiwiirc.com/"&gt;Kiwi IRC&lt;/a&gt;
based solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change will occur during this weekend (June 22nd / 23rd).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiwi IRC is an extensible and modern webchat solution, making IRC a lot easier
and more comfortable to use for both newcomers and long time users.
In addition to a clean and friendly UI it supports translations into
various languages, easier formatting and usage of emoji and advanced
customization for power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most existing links and bookmarks should continue to work, including sites
embedding the freenode webchat; please do let us know if you are running into issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank everybody who supported us during this migration,
most of all Kiwi's developer, prawnsalad, who provided a huge amount of code,
adaptations, options and testing that should ensure a smooth migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with this change, we will no longer apply gateway cloaks to users
of our webchat, treating them the same as any other client. While channel
operators will still be able to recognize them via the realname field,
we strongly suggest that you carefully consider the impact on legitimate
users and hope that you decide not to ban webchat users as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the old webchat will no longer be available after this migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for using freenode, via our new Kiwi webchat or any other client you prefer!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>ircd-seven 1.1.8</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/seven-118" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-17T10:15:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-17T10:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>edk</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2019-06-17:/news/seven-118</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're preparing to release version 1.1.8 of ircd-seven and deploy it to the
production network over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release incorporates a number of user-facing changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ircv3.net/specs/core/monitor-3.2"&gt;Monitor&lt;/a&gt; is restored to a usable state, and will be re-enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam filtering can be opted-out of. Setting mode &lt;code&gt;+u&lt;/code&gt; on yourself (
   &lt;code&gt;/umode +u&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/mode yournick +u&lt;/code&gt;) will disable filtering for messages
   sent to you. Setting it on a channel will disable filtering for all
   messages sent to that channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/motd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/stats&lt;/code&gt; are no longer ratelimited unless directed at a
   specific server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also introducing support for several IRCv3 features that may improve the
experience on capable clients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/away-notify-3.1"&gt;Away Notifications&lt;/a&gt; are supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/chghost-3.2"&gt;CHGHOST&lt;/a&gt; is supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/sts"&gt;Strict Transport Security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/tls-3.1"&gt;STARTTLS&lt;/a&gt; are enabled. (We know
   STARTTLS is deprecated and a bit out of date, but we'd still like to get
   as many people as possible using TLS one way or another.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/userhost-in-names-3.2"&gt;Userhosts in NAMES&lt;/a&gt; is supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one more change that is not related to this release, but deserves
mention: nearly two years ago, we developed an improvement to the &lt;code&gt;+z&lt;/code&gt; channel
mode, which sends messages that would have been blocked by &lt;code&gt;+q&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;+m&lt;/code&gt; to
channel operators instead. Our new version sends these messages to ops from the
&lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;-prefixed version of the channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:e!e@freenode/staff/spy.edk PRIVMSG @#test :I'm quieted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to make it easier for operators to distinguish between messages everyone can see
and messages they can see due to &lt;code&gt;+z&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This borrows the syntax from an existing feature, &lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00#section-4.18"&gt;STATUSMSG&lt;/a&gt;, but
is easy to tell apart from it, because only ops and voiced users can send to
&lt;code&gt;@channel&lt;/code&gt; normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gated this behind a feature switch, and we've been waiting, largely
passively, for client support to increase. It appears that everyone who wants to
act on warnings has done so, and we'd like to commit to a date to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We'll be enabling this feature on the 31st of July 2019, UTC.&lt;/strong&gt; If you op a
channel that uses &lt;code&gt;+z&lt;/code&gt;, please make sure your client handles it correctly.
You can send test messages by using &lt;code&gt;/msg @#channel test&lt;/code&gt; using a second opped
connection for any channel where you have ops—your client should associate
this message with &lt;code&gt;#channel&lt;/code&gt;, and preferably distinguish it from normal

&lt;p&gt;I am confident that we will do a more extensive recap when we have started to recover from the weekend, but before I nod off to sleep I want to do a huge shout-out of thanks to those of the freenode #live participants that hailed from underrepresented groups. In a time where the world is oftentimes unjust and outright scary it has been an incredibly inspiring and empowering experience to meet so many of you this weekend. I am under no illusion that there isn't a fight still to be had to ensure full inclusion and equality and I am incredibly happy that you form a growing and significant part of our community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of you are aware, we've been experiencing significant spam over the
past few weeks. As a result, we have decided to roll out a server-side spam
filter. Unlike our current spam-mitigating techniques, this system applies to
private messages and does not let the first matching line get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various ethical concerns have been raised over the course of introducing this
feature. They'll be addressed below. The short version, though, is that the
system has various limitations built in designed to prevent operator abuse.
Only a tiny bit of information can get out of the filters, and they do not have
access to much information themselves, to the extent that we believe the
obvious ways to abuse such a feature are impractical.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

Only a tiny bit of information can get out of the filters, and they do not have
access to much information themselves, to the extent that we believe the
obvious ways to abuse such a feature are impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've historically been reluctant to take steps like this, and we remain so,
but we believe the disruption has reached such a level that this is necessary
to allow the communities using freenode to collaborate effectively. The prior
complement of anti-spam measures represents our preferred approach, and we
intend to employ this only when they prove insufficient to minimize disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the technically inclined, you can view the changes
&lt;a href="https://github.com/freenode/ircd-seven/compare/000aa02980b812a18652fc2cc21041eb7adc980b...6ffdaf49400643a922fc9086f7a645ddd07013a6"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could this be used to spy on users?&lt;/em&gt; Which filter a user matched is not
  reported to staff, only that one did. This limits the theoretical maximum
  rate of passive monitoring to one bit per message, far less than the
  information content of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recipients of private messages are not included in the line that filters
match on, so staff cannot use spam filters to see who is talking to whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could this be used to shadowban users?&lt;/em&gt; No. If a filter blocks a message,
  its sender is either disconnected from the network or sent an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the filter system is configured not to use the nick, username, or
hostname for filter matching, so it can't discriminate against particular
users at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact information filters "see" is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type of message (PRIVMSG/NOTICE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The target of the message, if that target is a channel. For private
  messages, filters can see that they are PMs but not who their target is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether or not the sender is identified (but not their account name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full contents of the message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code can be configured to filter on the &lt;code&gt;nick!user@host&lt;/code&gt; of the sender. We
haven't enabled this, and have no current plans to, but this is subject to
change should the nature of the spam demand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering is always performed on the server originating a message, and inside
the ircd process. This system will never cause a message to be distributed
more widely than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff can, as always, answer your questions about this change, and we welcome
constructive feedback. Private messages to staff are not subject to filtering.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Continued and persistent spambot attack and clarification</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/spam-shake" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-06T06:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-08-06T06:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>christel</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2018-08-06:/news/spam-shake</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware there has been a prolonged spambot attack directed at freenode (and other IRC networks) in recent weeks, targeting a number of individuals involved with freenode and the wider IRC communities. The freenode team, and people involved with the wider IRC communities, are working hard to mitigate and reduce the spam that hits your community channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spam content has changed in the last few days and while I am extremely glad that the attacks appear to no longer focus on members of the volunteer team and no longer involve libellous and false statements relating to these volunteers, we feel we should provide some clarification on some of the claims that are being made in the current spamwave relating to freenode and its involvement in Handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current spambot attacks state that freenode is involved with an 'ICO scam' relating to the &lt;a href="https://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake&lt;/a&gt; project. Most freenode volunteers have involvement with one or several FOSS projects, often projects that use the freenode network as part of their communications toolbox. Handshake is no different in this regard, as it is a project that I have been involved with. I am deeply sorry to those affected by the spam, to freenode and to Handshake that spammers have chosen to use my involvement as a further platform to attack the freenode communities, and now also Handshake. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware there has been a prolonged spambot attack directed at freenode (and other IRC networks) in recent weeks, targeting a number of individuals involved with freenode and the wider IRC communities.

I am deeply sorry to those affected by the spam, to freenode and to Handshake that spammers have chosen to use my involvement as a further platform to attack the freenode communities, and now also Handshake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to announcement, the Handshake project raised USD 10.2 million in funding from project supporters and the project made the decision to not only give a substantial amount of its coin supply to people and projects within the FOSS sphere but to also donate the USD 10.2 million (FIAT) to projects whose work the initial project contributors admire and/or rely upon. Like many projects within the FOSS world, Handshake has extensively used other free and open source software to build its codebase, and FOSS also lies at the foundations of the internet architecture that we rely upon day to day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the projects Handshake identified as useful is indeed also freenode, which is on the pledgee list to receive a FIAT donation from the project. This donation will, among other things, contribute towards making the &lt;a href="https://freenode.live"&gt;freenode #live&lt;/a&gt; conference bigger and better, and also to focus on some development work that has otherwise been on the back-burner. freenode is happy to be included as a list of recipients and honoured to be appreciated in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is a FOSS project, and like many FOSS projects it has a channel on the freenode network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer DNS for which one aim is to be more resistant to censorhip than existing systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is doing a faucet distribution to a number of FOSS contributors and projects, many of which are freenode users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handshake is making a fairly hefty (USD 10.2 million) overall financial contribution to projects within the FOSS sphere in addition to its faucet allocation of HNS coins and freenode is one of many projects within the FOSS sphere that is receiving a contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, any link between freenode and Handshake is tenuous at best and the current wave of spam would appear to be designed to do little bar discredit freenode and the Handshake project both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you will appreciate that the freenode volunteer team is not in a position to answer questions relating to the Handshake project any more than they are in a position to answer questions relating to any other new FOSS project that starts to use the freenode network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also understand that some of you may have additional questions relating to Handshake, I am sure you will appreciate that the freenode website is not the platform for such a discussion, and would suggest that you visit the &lt;a href="https://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/handshake-org"&gt;Handshake Github Repository&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://handshake-org.github.io/"&gt;Handshake Documentation&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in learning more about the project and that you direct any questions to the Handshake project via the appropriate communication channels for the project.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Current spambot attack on freenode (and elsewhere)</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/spambot-attack" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-27T13:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-27T13:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>christel</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2018-07-27:/news/spambot-attack</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many of you will have noticed that over the last few days there has been an extensive spambot wave on freenode, and on other networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VM (aka Vicky) spent most of her 20 years in the tech industry leading software development departments and teams, and providing technical management and leadership consulting for small and medium businesses. Now she leverages nearly 30 years of free and open source software experience and a strong business background to &lt;a href="https://vmbrasseur.com/services"&gt;advise companies about free/open source, technology, community, business, and the intersections between them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is the author of &lt;a href="https://fossforge.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forge Your Future with Open Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first book to detail how to contribute to free and open source software projects. Think of it as the missing manual of open source contributions and community participation. The book is published by &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/"&gt;The Pragmatic Programmers&lt;/a&gt; and is now available in an &lt;a href="https://fossforge.com"&gt;early release beta version&lt;/a&gt;.

She's the proud winner of the Perl White Camel Award (2014) and the O’Reilly Open Source Award (2016).
